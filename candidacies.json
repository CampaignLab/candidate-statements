My parents worked locally in Broadmoor for many years and I am close to this area having been born in Norther Ireland. My wife was born in Wokingham and the children, David and Keelin locally at Frimley.\n\nCareer wise I have set up the European operations of many IT Software companies and spent a lot of my time over past 20 years in European countries most weeks.\n\nI guess, like many prospective Reform UK voters we have been left politically homeless by the two major parties, many of us would have been Conservatives who have appeared to have abandoned any genuine Conservative policies. Reform has a truly Conservative manifesto that I believe relates to the majority of UK voters and we need to start to breakdown the 2 party aspect that gives all of us as voters no clear view of any differentiation between the two.\n\nThe aftermath of the 2016 referendum was dismal, the first in my adult life and to see the politicians try to overturn at every opportunity saddened me that voters were treated with such disdain, whatever anyone’s thoughts of the result, democracy has to be put first.\n\nOur current Government has squandered all goodwill, ignoring their members and voters, and presenting Labour with an open goal, but one that the normal voter won’t notice any difference, changes occur in every life and context, by having true competition from other more current support political topics can the electorate truly be reflected in a changing UK.\n\nI’m a huge supporter of change in every context, that old saying of “doing things same way for years and expecting different results” spurs me on and seems so apt to our current UK Governing parties.\n\nWokingham is an area I have spent most of my adult life in and around, both work and pleasure, an area that has changed hugely and as a strong Conservative base it would perhaps be an area that feels let down by the Government. In John Redwood the area does have a true Conservative MP, one that looks very isolated in the current party? If we could achieve a point where we elect One, Two, Three MPs then with stamina and momentum/energy we can really start to make inroads to affect positive change and momentum.\n\nWokingham is an affluent area, there is no argument to that and perhaps a little stronger than many other areas, however the issues that are important will be identified by the electorate. I would never presume to know every issue of the Town and area, but would give 100% time and commitment to assist with the most compelling and identified electorate issues that arise, giving a voice to every single person who needs it, or wants it.",

He now lives with his family on the outskirts of Chobham village, just to the north of Woking.\n\nNew to politics, Richard finally made the decision to stand once the gradual morphing of the two-party system into a single mindset became palpable. Uncontrolled mass immigration, high taxation, low growth and big state/state interference are now endorsed on both sides of the political divide.\n\nFurthermore, a total failure to address the ‘woke’ agenda which has taken root across society, eroding freedom of speech, re-writing our history, threatening our culture - indeed, our very identity as a nation - can only be interpreted as endorsement of its objectives. Add a ‘coalition of groupthink’ on Net Zero to the mix and incalculable economic damage is inevitable without a rapid change of direction.\n\nRichard is a staunch advocate of informed decision-making based on free, open and honest debate, supported by all available data and ensuring the full spectrum of views are heard. This is the path to wisdom, enabling humanity to address the great issues of our time. He is also a great believer in good governance, recognising that reform of many public institutions is needed to ensure authority is vested appropriately, with effective oversight, to minimise unfavourable outcomes - Woking Borough Council’s bankruptcy being a case in point.\n\nHe is now standing for Reform UK to provide the people of Woking with a genuine alternative to the establishment parties; a party with an aspirational vision based on common sense and British values.\n\nIf you, too, seek real change, join us, volunteer and help us campaign!",

        "statement_to_voters": "Childhood - Having been born in Watford in 1963, I was brought up  by my amazing parents, in Northwood, Middlesex for all of my childhood, with my brothers Mark and Ian.\n\nCareer - I am a Chartered Surveyor. Having qualified from Cauldon College, Stoke-on-Trent in 1987, I gained valuable training and experience at Hillier Parker and Phoenix Beard. I established my own practice Phoenix & Partners in 1999, with offices in London and High Wycombe.\n\nFamily -  I am married to my very patient and tolerant wife Lizzie and we have two children, Mia and Ben. We have lived in High Wycombe since 2016 and love it here.\n\nPolitics – Politics has always been in my blood, having been involved in the Conservative party, UKIP, the Brexit Party and now of course Reform UK. I have been the candidate in several local elections and a General Election candidate in 2017.\n\nNational View – This country is great. It has been badly let down by successive governments obsessed with power only. The UK desperately needs political change in the House of Commons, House of Lords and electoral reform.\n\nWe need to believe in ourselves, have a vision and march towards our goals, without fear, without being concerned with the opinions of 3rd party leaders of other countries, or unelected institutions. Immigration is putting far too much strain on our national services and high taxes are stifling our industry. We need to slash both of these and put Britain first.\n\nWycombe\n\nH! - Hospital H! - Homeless  H! - High Street\n\nHospital - Wycombe\n\nWe need a new hospital!\n\nWycombe Hospital is in disrepair. Built in the 1960s, it is in increasingly precarious condition: Cramped wards, poor ventilation and growing water damage. Currently £2m per year is spent on repairs for a building that will be “not fit for use in the next 5 years”, according to a 2022 report by the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-65913081\n\nIf elected, I plan to lobby Westminster to totally rebuild it, not simply install an A&E unit and ignore the root of the problem.\n\nHomelessness – Wycombe\n\nHomelessness is widespread, and not limited to those sleeping rough: It can also take the form of couch-surfing or living in temporary accommodation. Charities such as Wycombe Homeless Connection are working hard to rehouse as many as possible, but without change on a national level, they’re fighting an uphill battle.\n\nAt the core of ending homelessness is addressing the rising cost of living. The average UK citizen already spends 28% of their income on rent, and are forced to pay ridiculous taxes. Only Reform UK will scrap energy bill VAT, lift the income tax starting point to £20,000 a year, and cut residential Stamp Duty to 0% below £750,000.\n\nTo make homelessness a thing of the past, central government, local authorities and charities must work together.\n\nAs the Wycombe MP, I would seek to raise the profile of this issue, working with Wycombe Homeless Connection,  OneRecoveryBucks (ORB), Aylesbury Homeless Action Group amongst others, in a coordinated approach with Buckinghamshire County Council.\n\nBy the way, more social housing would be a starting point!\n\nHigh Street - Wycombe\n\nWycombe is strategically located, with direct and speedy access to both London and Birmingham by train.  The town has an excellent road communication network with the M40 leading to the M25 and the national motorway network.\n\nThe industry in Wycombe is diverse and strong.\n\nThe out of town retail is diverse and strong.\n\nWith a strong community already, I wholeheartedly believe that we can build Wycombe into a major cultural hub - and that starts with the heart of the town: the high street.\n\nAs your MP, I’ll put together a task force to revamp Wycombe High Street. This requires a close dialogue with stakeholders - landlords, Buckinghamshire Council and working alongside organisations such as the High Wycombe Regeneration Board, The High Wycombe Society and Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce. The aim would be to sell the High Street to retailers and restaurants to locate here in our High Street, to compete with Beaconsfield and Marlow.\n\nA revamped high street is a revamped Wycombe.\n\nBy the way a Wycombe Town Council would be a good start.\n\nBy the way also, Reform UK’s pledge to :\n\n‘Abolish business rates for small & medium firms, offset with Online Delivery Tax at 3%, which will create a fairer playing field for High Street and physical versus online businesses’...is a good start!",

I am 57 years old and I have lived in South Wales for most of my working life, where I also share eight children with my wonderful partner of ten years.  Born and raised in Blackmill, nr Bridgend, to a large family of four sisters and one twin brother, it was expected that I would find work as a coal miner. However, by the time I had left school, the coal industry was closing down, leaving the area in which I was living, socially and economically decimated.\n\nI eventually found work in a local engineering factory in Bridgend, where I stayed for over twenty years until 2003, when I was unfortunately made redundant. The closures this time were due to EU incentives given to factory owners to re-locate elsewhere in Europe, again without a single thought for the economic decimation of up to three generations of workers these decisions would cause.\n\nA new work opportunity, however, eventually brought me to the town of Neath, to work for the community ambulance service as a driver, followed by work for a homeless charity which I did for the next ten years. For the last six years I have worked in a local garage as a fitter. This work brought me in line with one of my great sporting passions, namely motorcycle racing. In the last 30 or so years that I have been involved in the sport and as well as helping my twin brother to win multiple times, I have also achieved many titles myself, which include Welsh Hill Climb Champion, Ultimate Street Bike Champion, Welsh Sprint Champion, Sidecar Champion and Fastest Welshman. I also hold three British land speed records conducted at Pendine Sands. I enjoy the camaraderie of the race paddock where I am proud to call all the people involved our ‘extended family’.\n\nI want to give the constituents of Aberafan and Maesteg the opportunity to vote for Reform UK in this General Election and I want to do this because I believe the political classes have betrayed the electorate. I for one did not vote for mass uncontrolled immigration and neither did my friends, family, nor many of the people I speak to whilst out and about. In 2016 we won the referendum for a full EU exit but it’s like it has not happened. The knock on effect of uncontrolled immigration has had on our local services, housing and general quality of life has been devastating while our local politicians obsess over achieving net zero carbon instead. I feel for the first time our children will have a poorer quality of life than we had. I believe only the Reform UK party can begin to fix this by giving the power back to the people who understand what's going on in the real world.",

A vote for me is a vote to prevent more of these being built in the future.\n\nOn a national level, I intend to press for widespread reforms of government services, which successive governments, especially this one, have degraded to the extent that they are not fit for purpose. Examples include:\n\nThe Probate Registry. The reforms that started in 2020 have led to considerable delays causing much misery to bereaved families who have had to wait considerable periods of time to obtain a Grant of Probate. Prior to 2020, the typical time to obtain a Grant was 3-4 weeks. It now takes a minimum of 4-6 months since the government have centralised the procedure with no ability to expedite urgent applications. The Land Registry. Waiting times have increased considerably to complete registration of purchases, transfers, leases, and deaths. It now takes about 2 years for the Land Registry to process a lease application. This was never the case before. The government have dispensed with the services of many experienced staff leading to the lengthy delays. The Court system. The courts are understaffed, and many are poorly maintained. Particularly, many cases are prolonged due to inadequate staffing, and this causes a loss of confidence in the Justice system. Roads are poorly maintained, causing potholes, which cause accidents, and therefore, are costly because the local authority is faced with paying for compensation. Would it not be cheaper to maintain the roads and pavements, thus reducing claims. VAT on private school fees will impact the entire education system. Many private schools, including faith schools, may have to close, as the parents will no longer afford to pay the fees. This will cause strain on the already over-subscribed state schools. Health service. Despite record-breaking amounts of money being poured into the NHS, 12% of British people are on a waiting list. Clearly, there are reforms needed to have better efficiency. The tax system has penalised senior doctors, who have, therefore, left practice. The tax system disincentivises movement within the property sector. For example, stamp duty is a disincentive on people moving house and investing in property. Landlords have been a target for the tax man, including higher Stamp Duty Land Tax, and higher tax on rent, as they cannot fully reclaim the financial costs of borrowing against the rental income. Additionally, Capital Gains Tax allowances have been drastically reduced. Privatisation has been a disaster, since it has enriched those who own the water companies who have very little accountability, resulting in the poisoning of the water supply, including rivers, beaches, and lakes. Besides all of this, the shadow of Blairism still looms large over Britain. The population explosion that he began and the Tories have sped up. This has obviously created a dire shortage in housing, doctors, nurses, and schools. It has also created overcrowding in prisons, and transport.\n\nA vote for me is a vote to halt the managed decline of Britain. Above all, a vote for me is a vote for a positive vision of a country that operates as it should.",

As a local family man and business owner, living and employing people in the constituency, I am in a privileged position to have the opportunity to connect with pretty much every demographic and to share our common concerns and indeed aspirations. Having been elected twice as a Borough and Town councillor, in Bracknell, I am realistic about what can be achieved with proper planning, hard work and collaboration.

I can see where a large portion of our issues lie and neither of the two larger parties in this country are taking the necessary steps to fix it.\n\nFrom the NHS, to taxation, to the betrayal of Scottish energy from Westminster AND the party who is supposed to have Scotland’s best interest at heart (SNP), we have been let down time and time again, and it’s time for a change. Being from the North East of Scotland where 1 in 5 people are employed in the Oil and Gas industry, Scottish Energy is vital to the people of this area and the ruthless pursuit of Net Zero by the current administration is detrimental to our industry.\n\nThe disrespect shown to our agricultural community across the country by the Conservative Party is immense. They have turned their back on our Farmers and the Labour Party aren’t doing enough to address this. We need a party for the average working class British person and Reform can deliver this.\n\nI want to make a change not only for me but for everyone. I hear from all generations, their frustration with the country going between Conservative and Labour, but a majority of them feel helpless. This isn’t how democracy should work. Everyone should have a voice. I could go on all day listing reasons for frustrations with our government, along with reasons I think we can change this country for the better.\n\nLet’s put an end to the endless lies we are fed from “traditional parties” and show them what the British people actually want and return our country to its former glory.",

        "name": "Richard Andrew Pearse",
        "statement_to_voters": "Introduction - Hi, I am Richard Pearse. I am thrilled to be nominated as the Reform UK parliamentary candidate for Weston-Super-Mare. I am a West Country Boy raised by a single mother in social housing with my five brothers, leading me to value family loyalty, education, hard work, and love for our country. These values led me to complete the 'All Arms Commando Course' at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines at seventeen; after earning my 'Green Beret', I served with 29 Commando RA, Plymouth. I am now a former widower with children and happily remarried to a qualified nurse.\n\nProfessional Experience- After leaving the services, I worked as a rural postman, night shift baker, and taxi driver, teaching me valuable lessons about people and serving the public. I then earned my first degree at the University of Exeter in Business & Accountancy. Later, I gained an MBA and completed PhD training while lecturing in management. I stepped away from higher education to implement my research findings in the public domain within the financial services industry, helping small businesses and individuals. This journey, filled with challenges and triumphs, led to professional recognition as a 'Fellow' of the Institute of Consultancy and a 'Chartered Manager and Fellow' of the Chartered Management Institute. I took early retirement at 55.\n\nMy Motivation - I am loyal to our country, respecting individual independence and family values. I believe in a strong work ethic, believing we share responsibility for each other and the vulnerable by demanding change, given successive political governments have failed to adequately address the acute shortages in Housing, the NHS, Defence, Education, and Energy with Government spending seemingly not held entirely to account. \n\nHope for our Future- Many of us have patiently waited to see politicians bring our country out of the mess we find ourselves in while operating with a moral compass, which compass appears missing as politicians cling to power when faced with an ethical dilemma. It is time to 'Reform' our political system while moving our country to a secure financial footing. Like many others, as your Reform Party Candidate, I am committed to their assessment that the existing political parties no longer represent our growing concerns. So, I am not just a candidate but a beacon of hope for a better political future. I hope you agree with that assessment and support my candidacy to become your MP.",

I am also a Reform UK Ward Councillor. \n\nAt a local level I work hard representing residents and helping wherever possible with their local issues. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council has been under Labour control since formation and comes under intense scrutiny locally due to some of the decisions made and ambitious projects undertaken, including a town centre shopping arcade with an initial budget of £45m which has risen to over £220m, and what many residents describe as a 'vanity project' footbridge, budgeted at £3m and still unfinished, having consumed some £13m and still counting. All contributing to the £850m Council debt.\n\nI have been politically active for as long as I can remember, until 18 months ago with the Conservative Party (after a short period as a member of The Brexit Party - now Reform UK).\n\nLike many people though, I became disillusioned with the last decade of Government, and I have experienced a Labour Government at their worst. I also witnessed Labours shift to the extreme left under Jeremy Corby, supported in full by Kier Starmer.\n\nI realised that I had become politically homeless, with neither of the main political parties offering common sense policies, credibility or demonstrating any care for communities or our Country. \n\nIn my view, many people are working just to survive, depending on benefit top-ups to make ends meet. And I abhor the woke obsession that this country is cascading towards, driven by a tiny minority.\n\nFreedom of speech is, in my view an essential element of our democracy, but we are constantly questioned over the use of 'inappropriate pronouns'. I worry where this may end up.\n\nFreedom to live our lives has been eroded by the level of control that this Conservative Government imposes over us. The war against the motorist, ULEZ, forcing electric cars on people that either can’t afford them or, like Jeremy Clarkson, simply don’t want them. \n\nUnisex toilets, over 10m immigrants welcomed in the last 20 years with minimal improvements to roads, rail, schooling, NHS or defence. Our legal system close to collapse, prisons over capacity, net zero being forced upon us whilst developing countries belch out CO2 with scant regards for us sat in queues waiting for electric car charging points that aren’t compatible or simply don’t work.\n\nI approached Reform UK after studying their policies and watching their rapid growth over the last few years. I met very senior level Reform UK people and liked what I heard. The party shares pretty much every view that I hold.  Switching to Reform UK was not a difficult decision, and I do not have a single regret.\n\nPeople do say to me that a vote for Reform UK is a vote for Labour. In my opinion, the Conservatives are already set for many years in the wilderness regardless. And deservedly so for what they have done to our people and country.\n\nWhat we need is a fresh approach, fresh ideas, and people in Westminster that are the genuine voice and representation of the people. An honourable position that the Labour Party betrayed and lost many years ago.\n\nMore than at any time in history, regardless of whoever is in Government, we need strong people opposing and challenging their tired and failed policies.\n\nMany people also ask me what I could hope to achieve if elected with Reform UK in Barnsley South. Simply, I can be the biggest voice that Barnsley has ever had in Westminster. Unwhipped, holding any Government to account relating to local and national issues, I enjoy nothing more than helping people in any way that I am able, and challenging crazy ideas and policies.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for Barnsley residents to finally have their say at the highest level.\n\nVote as you always have, expect more of the same. But don't complain.",

Then I read Reform UK’s policies, and they are like a breath of fresh air.  They are just good old fashioned common sense which is what we’ve all been asking for during these years of Conservative infighting and mismanagement. \n\nRaising the starting point of income tax to £20,000 whilst reforming the benefits system will help millions of economically inactive people back into work that benefits their mental health as well as their bank balance knocking onto a gain for society in general.\n\nThe Tories have failed and a lurch to socialism is not the answer.

The Conservatives have proven themselves untrustworthy and more focused on themselves than the crucial tasks at hand. LibDems after 30 years are still getting nowhere, and the socialists have hijacked the Green Party.\n\nWhilst some representatives of these parties may, in isolation, have some strong and noble ideas, the truth is that the aforementioned parties don’t have a clue how to provide sustainability. It appears they are too busy arguing with themselves rather than finding a cohesive or successful plan designed to generally improve people’s lives.\n\nTo have any chance of choosing a better future, you have to reject false promises, identify facts and determine what is real. I don’t know about you, but I am fed up sailing in this ship of fools. For the past 40 years, successive political parties have failed to create a fair or even happy country. All politicians are to blame but soon, in this election, you have a chance for a fresh start and a proper focus on the truth. So you don’t get fooled again.\n\nReforming opportunities in Britain by using Standards makes everything better.\n\n1) Cost of living - Buying British, supporting food security, and choosing self-sufficiency in energy - solar, wind, water, etc.- reduce prices. Putting UK business first. 2) Access to services has been slashed due to the level of demand. NHS, utilities, insurance, and housing (air development) are available. So why don’t we put the elderly, women and children first? 3) Law and Order - We can stop violence, such as knife crime and theft, simply by having more police focused on catching criminals. Putting safety first. 4) Women’s rights – putting women first. Of course, there should be equality for everyone, but there should be no confusion that biological sex is respected in society, sports and clubs. 5) Migration should be managed, because more, means we are all poorer. Increasing the population makes us all poorer. The provision of public services has not improved. As a result, UK citizens, together with growing numbers of migrants, are all forced to struggle for the same GP appointments, NHS waiting lists, school places, reduced housing supply, and soaring prices. We had a stable population from 1968 to 1998, thirty years of increasing living standards. Why not just manage society, the environment, and economics to benefit the UK and its national interest? You know like we used to... This competition for services cannot continue, as it's is in no one’s interest and is caused by just too many people and insufficient utilities.\n\nFIND IT & FIX IT\n\nCareful spending, reducing demand, having British/International standards and delivering good management can solve anything.

A country cannot be self-sufficient if it cannot feed itself and our farmers are struggling as the Net Zero regulations clamp down on them.  The price of red diesel has been increased, farmers are being paid to re-wild their land thus reducing the number of crop producing fields and now with the closure of Britain’s only ammonia plant, there will be a huge increase in fertiliser costs.  It is Reform UK policy to increase the farming budget to £3 Billion with a focus on smaller farms, to keep farmland in use to produce food and to bring young people into farming. WE want to help our farmers to carry on farming. It is also another Reform UK policy to renegotiate our fishing arrangements with EU and help our fishing communities build back the communities and heritage. \n\nI want to help empower local communities and be a voice on their behalf and bring about real change, restoring trust in political leadership and fostering a brighter future for all.",

I am thrilled at the prospect of being able to put forward fresh ideas and the option for real change after years of political mismanagement and dishonesty by both Labour and the Tories. I will speak up for the silent majority who have been so badly let down by successive governments.\n\nI am proud to champion Reform UK’s exciting manifesto which will make an immediate impact on the working population.\n\nThe cost of living crisis is taking money straight out of your pocket and has been directly impacted by poor political decisions.\n\nReform UK will make the first £20,000 you earn free from income tax. We will also scrap VAT on energy bills and lower the fuel duty to save on energy bills. This will not only help every person in the UK directly but every business in the UK.\n\nBedford is a beautiful town, however the number of empty shops is growing rapidly. If we continue on this course of action, businesses will continue to close and there will be irrevocable damage done to the town centre and the community. Along with savings on energy bills, we will remove business rates for small high street businesses to give small independent retailers a chance to compete again. We will also reduce Corporation tax back to 20% to encourage investment and start the economy rolling again.\n\nWhile our tax is at the highest it has been since WW2 our public services are crumbling. Record levels of immigration have put a strain on our housing, NHS and schooling. We need a sensible immigration plan to ensure that we have enough homes, school places and medical care for our population. We must put a halt on non-essential immigration to allow us to catch up.\n\nIllegal immigration must stop. Zero illegal entry immigrants will be resettled in the UK. We will process the applications quickly and efficiently and when possible return the migrants to France and work with our French Counterparts to stop the criminal gangs making millions off these illegal journeys.\n\nNationally our streets feel unsafe and Bedford is no different. Knife crime especially, is a very real cause of concern in our community. Our streets need more police, we will recruit 40,000 new front life officers. We will also allow our police to do their jobs, we will bring back stop and search in high risk areas to directly combat drug dealing and knife crime.\n\nOur NHS needs Reform. The frontline NHS staff are some of the greatest people our nation has to offer. However, our NHS spending is at record levels with the wait times and service being at an all time low. Our spending per person is in alignment with many other western countries the issues the NHS face are bloated management, bureaucracy and poor procurement. We will model our reforms on other European Countries modern Healthcare systems to bring you the best possible free at the point of use service.\n\nWe are ruled by an out of touch elite, to change this we will bring in; Proportionate Representation, reform the House of Lords to a much smaller second chamber and reform the Civil Service.\n\nWe need a common-sense shift to stop the decline and end the two party system. This is only possible with your vote! We are a rapidly growing movement, if you would like to help out or get involved please get in touch.",

Our contract winter maintenance business lasted until high fuel costs made it uneconomic.\n\nI may only be 30 but having been brought up on the farm and having been lucky enough to have had a father who gave me responsibility for running the farm has given me an excellent grasp of the business and personal struggles of the real world.

It’s hard to find a good job, and when you do, the wages are low and your chances of getting on the housing ladder are close to zero - especially if you’re doing it on your own.  Rents keep increasing, house-prices have sky-rocketed and being able to be independent and start a family is increasingly difficult for the young people of our country.\n\nThis is due to the horrendous mis-management of our government… since before I was even born!  Whether it is a Labour Government, or a Conservative one in charge, the issues that everyone faces are becoming increasingly worse, and young people never stood a chance.\n\nThe NHS is overloaded leading to insane waiting lists for basic health service, young people cannot compete for high and even low-paying jobs, and taxes keep increasing. This simply cannot continue.\n\nA large part of this is down to the mass immigration policies of the last 20 years. Tony Blair’s Labour opened the gates, and the Conservative Government has been even worse. In 2022 alone the Conservative Government allowed 1.2 million new people into our country.  This is simply unsustainable.\n\nAnd I cannot state clearly enough, this is not a racial issue - like the media and Government Establishment like to paint it out as, this is a looking-after-our-people issue, borne out of love for the people of our great country.\n\nLocally, I care deeply about all of Ashton-under-Lyne and the people that live here. I was born in Tameside Hospital, grew up in Hyde, went to college in Ashton, rented in Mottram, lived in Stalybridge, and now own a house with my fiancée in Mossley. I’ve seen the degradation of Dukinfield, Droylsden, Audenshaw, and Ashton-under-Lyne first-hand.\n\nAs a child, we would come to Ashton-under-Lyne for a day out.

I am willing to work with the local council, to bring life back into town by reducing crime, supporting small businesses, restoring our beautiful but decaying buildings and ultimately regenerate what was once a great town.\n\nI’m not a politician, so I’m not going to tell you that there is a quick and easy answer to these issues and make a bunch of false promises that I couldn’t possibly deliver on.  But with a fresh approach, and good ideas from all of the people who actually live in Dukinfield, Droylsden, Audenshaw and Ashton-under-Lyne, I will be your representative, and over the long term we can turn our great towns around and turn our great country around.",

Most of my teaching happened in the inner city of Bristol, although I have experience of Bath schools as a supply teacher (Culverhey, St Mark and Hayesfield).\n\nBoth my sons still live in the city but I am one of the many who have become squeezed out for a number of reasons. \n\nProfessionally, I have turned my hands to several ways of earning a living and have been self-employed for a much longer time that I was salaried. So, I have a wide experience of the world and know how to survive economically. \n\nMy political career began when I won two landslide victories for two consecutive years as a classroom rep, age 14 and 15. Since then I have had a tendency of volunteering for unpleasant jobs that most shy away from. \n\nMore recently, I became chocked with frustration at the state of affairs in this country and decided to do something about it. Yet again I volunteered, this time with Reform UK, who entrusted me with becoming Wiltshire Coordinator. A task I undertook with such enthusiasm that I was recently promoted to Sub Coordinator for the South West. \n\nI keenly watched as not one but two candidates applied for the PPC position in Bath only to see both stand down because of personal reasons. So, here I am! \n\nWhat Bath will get with me is an honest candidate, who actually loves the city and has both fond and clear memories over 6 decades of living here. I know the problems you face, nationally and locally. My dedication and hard work will show and I will do my best to never let you down. \n\nI have been around Bath long enough to say I have driven over Pultney Bridge!\n\nSupport me if you want representation that is beyond ideology, representation that will really take account of your needs and your opinions.\n\nI'll be seeing you soon on the campaign and let's turn this city aqua blue!",

I am not a career politician. I am an ordinary working-class woman who cares – that’s what makes me different – I really do care.\n\nI am originally from Northumberland so understand the everyday difficulties faced by rural communities with little or no connectivity and wicked winters!  Between us, my husband and I have 8 children and 7 grandchildren so there isn’t much we haven’t encountered on the joys of parenthood, especially the hardship and teenage years. \n\nMy mam worked in the local ‘dole’ office and my dad was a miner during the 80s, and although we had nothing because of the strike, we lived in a close knit community that got through it with humour and kindness.  Worst memory was having to queue at the church for lunch during school holidays.  My dad inevitably lost his job but retrained as an offshore welder and life moved on.\n\nI have in excess of 25 years public sector experience at local, regional and national levels including managing what was the only National Identity Fraud Unit in the early 00s, moving on to managing serious and organised fraud and abroad fraud teams.  I have also worked in benefit departments, local authorities and more recently have contracted to provide a variety of services to mainly public sector organisations in project management, research, policy development, and investigative/compliance roles.\n\nDuring Covid, I worked on the National Test and Trace Programme delivering inter-ministerial group meetings and maintaining liaison for the devolved Governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, developing the governance protocol to ensure a true ‘four nations’ approach’ in delivering the national Covid19 response.\n\nIt is time to put our needs first and we will only achieve this through abolishing Westminster’s first past the post system. Reform UK would introduce proportional representation for UK parliamentary elections, ensuring every vote counts.   I will actively campaign for proportional representation in Westminster, making sure the people of Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber are heard loud and clear.\n\nI believe real independence is independence from government, doing what we want in the way we want to do it. The UK is one of the most centralised advanced democracies, that needs to change. Reform UK supports localised distribution of power and will deliver this by taking devolution to a new level, we will devolve more power from Westminster and Holyrood to regional levels.  Look at the influence Metro Mayors in England have.  If it’s good enough for them, then it’s good enough for the people of Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber. Only a Reform UK Government will deliver more devolution and independence from Westminster and Holyrood whilst retaining the safety and security of the Union.\n\nTo that end, I will work tirelessly to serve the people of Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber to ensure we are heard loud and clear in Westminster and beyond.",

Then I can advocate for common sense policy and help implement solutions. I currently practice as a solicitor in the local area and live just outside the boundary, where I have been for nearly 10 years.\n\nObjective\n\nMy objective is to be the dynamic and strong voice for the Aylesbury constituents.\n\nI believe in a small government, less bureaucracy, encouragement for small business, freedom for the individual, low tax, fair application of the law, personal responsibility and sovereignty of the UK.\n\nFundamentally I see Reform UK as the only way of bringing about change. Reform UK has a supercharged leadership and truly committed members, who really want to take action and have the will to make change actually happen.\n\nPolitical Development\n\nPolitics always seemed a waste energy to me – I never saw it accomplish the obviously needed changes. Too much discussion of promises with little or no action in my view.\n\nHowever, the Covid era changed my views on politics – it opened my eyes. For the first time I noticed the impact politicians have on us. Rather than shout my frustration at a screen, I decided to do something positive to address the problems I felt were getting worse locally and nationally.\n\nI decided I must put my shoulder to the wheel with other like-minded ordinary people who want change. So, I joined Reform UK over 18 months ago. Within our party there is drive and passion to make things better, to fix things. Reform members were always willing to discuss creative, out of the box solutions to problems that need radical rethinking. This was and is inspiring.\n\nHaving lived in France and Italy for nearly 10 years I experienced other ways of doing things, some better some worse. These countries have great pride in their cultural heritage and it would be great if we can build that again here. To fix the country we really need to put the wheels back on and drive confidently into the future. I really think that Reform UK can do that.\n\nGetting the word out\n\nIf you want to help build our future with Reform UK – please help us by spreading our message far and wide, that things can be better. Please get the word out in your social circles and on social media. Thank you.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Welcome, my name is Andrew Russell. I spent my teenage years in Ayr and stayed on in secondary school into the sixth year before training as an electrical electronics engineer, and progressing to a fulfilling career in the Royal Navy where I served 7 years on frigates in Plymouth and 15 years on submarines at Faslane.\n\nMy childhood was spent in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) where my schooling and my parents taught me the importance of paying attention to detail, to question everything, and to learn from mistakes and experiences. They instilled in me values of respect, fairness, politeness, tolerance and honesty.\n\nAfter my naval career I spent 20 years in the offshore oil and gas sector developing and maintaining subsea infrastructure aboard various vessels around the world on many varied subsea projects. All exciting stuff working with different nationalities and cultures and an adherence to punctuality, discipline and efficient teamwork, all essential qualities in an environment where time is money.\n\nThis is the reason I’m keen on promoting Reform UK policies for more technical jobs and to help businesses because they all provide valued jobs and are good for the economy, benefitting us all.\n\nWhy stand as the Reform UK Candidate PPC for Ayr, Carrick & Cumnock?  \n\nI joined Reform UK as I thought mainstream parties had gone off the rails, lost sight of what most of us are feeling and are no longer representing our views and preferring the woke agenda. Reform UK spoke my common sense ideals where mad net zero policies are too stringent, stifling growth and making us less competitive. Immigration is out of control in an already full country with housing shortages.\n\nThere are NHS concerns with over-the-top management and waste, lack of staff retention including carers. There is a better Reform UK way by valuing and incentivising the staff to stay on. We need more affordable housing to ease rents, and more Police to police without political interference and much more.\n\nMy submarine Commander once said to a group of my fellow crew members, “I want Russell in my control room; he’s got presence to ensure procedures are followed and is able to convey them reliably.” I hope to use this to encourage more tourism by making our unique coastal asset more marketable and a choice destination.\n\nWe need more tech and manufacturing around the airport, and improved A77 links to the ferries to Ireland by more overtaking and longer lanes. Look to expand the industrial site in Girvan and to support our local hard working farmers in our rural areas. One wonders what has happened to the promises of the Growth Deal and Spaceport, hollow words and it is simply not good enough just to make announcements and no action to be seen thereafter.\n\nNow retired and living close to my family home in Alloway, I have been active in local politics for several years. I retired early to take care of my late wife, formerly Miss Campbell of Holmston Primary 3, which was the right thing to do and now I wish to devote my energies to helping the constituents of Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock more vocally than previous representatives to improve investment into our area.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nI tend to gravitate towards those asking for help and have always been keen to pass on any knowledge. You may have seen my name in the letter page of the Ayrshire Post, Facebook or Alloway chat standing up for people, actively fighting and opposing local issues that didn’t make sense. Our constituency is rich in history and scenery and we should exploit our culture and heritage through tourism and leisure our main selling points.\n\nI was involved for over a year with Seeayr, a citizen group of 5 deciding something had to be done. We thrashed out strategic ideas and localities of entertainment for the area, bringing back venues including a multi functional arena. Disappointingly not a single Councillor showed any interest in the document which still has value and remains on my computer.\n\nAs a Community Council member and Chair I am often seen in the Council Chambers representing the community on some planning issue. Querying the closure of hospital wards and clinical procedures at Ayr hospital and wanting answers.\n\nI have concerns in the unfairness for those having to travel even further for treatments and the number of bus connections required. Realising the A77 Ayr bypass is fast becoming gridlocked and persevering to get the remaining 4 miles of bypass made dual carriageway. I am still advocating for a Citizens Advice Bureau for South Ayrshire which seems to be stalling in the Council. I am an advocate of protecting and keeping open space available in our towns.\n\nPromoting our beautiful constituency and time we had some action.\n\nNow with time on my hands I’d be keen to get round all the towns and villages in the constituency and see and hear what’s needed. I’d have an advantage in that I could speak out about any unwelcome policies of a mainstream party. Apart from newspaper and staged photo shoots when did you last see your MP/MSP? I want to rectify that; there is nothing better than meeting people and listening and getting the job done.\n\nI ask you to place your trust in Andrew Russell for MP to promote our constituency in full. I’m proud of where we live and what we have potential for on our doorstep. I ask you to put aside your former party allegiances and change for once our predictable, stagnating, self-serving political system and vote for the policies of Reform UK. Already many people from all parties are doing just this which is good news and I would encourage you all to read the Reform UK Contract and listen to our leader Richard Tice online.\n\nI look forward to meeting you in due course. Remember our logo, big X please.  I intend not to disappoint and thank you for your vote.",

        "statement_to_voters": "All friends know me as Jamie McNamee but my Sunday name is James.\n\nI was born and raised in Livingston and brought up knowing what was right and wrong. I left school immediately after completing my GCSEs and was immediately sent out to get a job to pay the rent. I went straight through to the big smoke in Edinburgh and started working in a kitchen peeling vegetables. I remained there until I left a not so great home life and moved out to the west coast to stay with family there. I started working again straight away on a YTS (Youth training scheme) as a butcher through the day and in the evening as a cleaner in the local Asda supermarket. I continued to work until I was old enough to join the Army at 16 years and 8 months where I remained for the following 13 years, I was predominantly a fitness/outdoor pursuits instructor teaching Kayaking, Rock Climbing, Sky diving and other such hair-raising pursuits. I completed my service at the rank of Sergeant which stood me in great stead for transitioning into civilian life. I gained valuable skills in speaking and delivering training and presentations to large groups of senior personnel. I also gained great experience with computing skills by constructing and delivering PowerPoint presentations and gaining valuable man management skills. My transition was relatively quick from military to civilian life where I moved back to Livingston to begin my current career as a saturation diver in the oil and gas sector. This role that has sent me all over the world and kept me working in extremely mentally and physically challenging conditions in the subsea construction environment and in a number of health and safety roles during quieter offshore periods, with many different nationalities and cultures.\n\nWhy am I standing for Reform Uk\n\nI will be brutally honest and start by saying I have never held an interest in politics. Over the past 30 years we have had government after government lie to our faces every time they speak and I’d just had enough of listening to the lies while our great country that many generations of our families fought to build into the GREAT Britain that it once was has been reduced to financial, cultural and Industrial ruin.\n\nHowever I am now a father of two amazing young girls and I fear for what the country will offer them in 10-15 years time when they are starting their young adult lives. I love my roots and I’m proud of where I come from and I am very much a traditionalist and love our British traditions and values. It pains me to think that I would have to advise my girls to emigrate to another country for a better life if the UK continues down its current path of financial and woke pandering destruction. As things stand, we as adults and parents are struggling now with high taxes, the cost of living crisis, families turning to food banks to feed their families, underfunded and crumbling public services, dwindling if not already destroyed Farming, Construction, Fishing and energy sectors to name but a few that Conservative, Labour and SNP governments have brought to their knees. Dare I even mention the corruption, theft and waste of billions of pounds that disappears from the public purse every year due to these millionaire politicians, while they tell us we must spend less time in the shower, turn the heating down, go and buy a new electric car all the while these people are driving around in motorcades and flying around in private jets .\n\nThere are so many reasons to vote for Reform UK and too many to list without losing everyone’s attention, what I am going to ask, even plead, that everyone who finds themselves on Reform’s website or with a flyer delivered by myself or other volunteers please take the time to read our policies as we want to completely change the landscape of UK politics to get to a stage where we have working class people holding the highest office position in government and actually working and writing policies that benefit the (backbone) working people of this country and please always keep in mind the masses will always outweigh the few. This fight will not be a quick fix it will take time but if I can convince enough people to become party members and pledge their vote to Reform UK then we have a starting point and come the following general election we hope to be in a position to remove said parties and start to rebuild our once great nation for our children’s and grandchildren’s sakes.",

Conditions are nothing short of a disgrace. Retroactive aid and generous remedial provision must be offered to all vets and their dependents with full and seamless medical, rehabilitation and social support, from re-training through to fees-paid higher education for all those who serve.\n\nRecruitment must be taken back from the bureaucrats and returned to the military and\n\nI argue that defence spending will soon have to soar well beyond the modest 3% of GDP mooted by Reform if we are to keep our people safe.\n\nBorder Force must be strengthened and coastal patrols stepped up if the small boats are to be turned back or stopped and their passengers incarcerated. But it’s really about ensuring all illegals and overstayers are intercepted, detained and whisked away for offshore processing and deportation, currently underestimated at 1.3 million souls, on one of many uninhabited islands in our Overseas Territories.\n\nWaste, Resistance and Mission Creep A root & branch overhaul of local government and the Civil Service is long overdue; the judicial system, the criminal justice system, the prisons and police ‘service’ are all underfunded, all in crisis, overburdened with non-jobs and have lost public confidence.\n\nOil & Gas Ditch the renewables tax grab and let’s wrap up this whole demented Net Zero distraction – Better we act decisively now to restore the fortunes of the UK’s world class oil and gas industry, embracing also our ample reserves of helium and hydrogen,\n\nGet Fracking Reform will revisit the region’s fracking and coalbed methane potential, incentivise exploration in the East Irish Sea and get that untapped gas ashore, shoring up the relevance of our Rampside Terminal for future generations.\n\nGovernment in a Straitjacket I will press for the immediate suspension of the Equalities Act, to expunge from these shores all reference to the divisive antiphrastic diktat of diversity, equity and inclusion. Reform will excise the European Convention on Human Rights and the so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards from our national life.\n\nHate Crime legislation and similar Orwellian provisions throughout the four nations will be removed from the statute book. With free speech we can take back our public spaces and rekindle informed debate on national issues.\n\nNo Wokery on my Watch !\n\nLet’s dismantle the institutional legacy left by the Blair and Heir-to-Blair regimes, let’s have that bonfire of laws and quangos we’ve been promised for far too long.\n\nOnly Reform UK can get the job done.\n\nGet involved, get onboard",

He stood for Parliament in 2015 as candidate for UKIP where he received one the highest votes for the party kicking the Liberal Democrats into fourth place.\n\nIn 2016 both he and his wife relocated to Retford where he rejoined the UKIP party in Bassetlaw.

Frank remains committed to replacing this iniquitous system of selection with Proportional Representation or the Single Transferable Vote which is the system adopted in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to select their devolved governments. If this system of selection is considered to be equitable and accountable for devolved governments within the United Kingdom, then why is it not also considered equitable and accountable for selecting the government in Westminster?\n\nFrank has commenced campaigning in the Bassetlaw towns of Worksop and Retford on Saturday mornings.

My experiences in a diverse socio-economic environment have fuelled my passion for individual liberties, personal responsibility, and limited government intervention.\n\nEarly Life and Education \n\nI hold an Engineering degree, and, for a long time, I lived my life without paying much more attention to politics than most people. My interest in politics was piqued by the Brexit debate. It seemed like a clear choice, yet the government's handling of the issues made me sit up and pay attention. Since then, I've delved into political philosophy, particularly the works of Ludwig von Mises, Thomas Sowell, Ron Paul, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. These intellectual pursuits have solidified my belief in the importance of free markets and individual freedoms as foundations of a prosperous society.\n\nCareer and Political Involvement\n\nAfter graduation, I embarked on a career as a consultant engineer, gaining firsthand experience of the regulatory challenges faced by businesses. This professional background significantly shaped my advocacy for deregulation and economic liberalization.  My transition into politics was driven by a desire to combat what I perceive as the overreach of government into citizens' lives and economic activities, exemplified by the events of 2020.\n\nI first entered the political arena by standing for local council elections. In 2023, I stood for Reform UK, attracted by the party's commitment to challenging the status quo and its platform on Brexit and mass immigration. Now, I am standing for the first time as a parliamentary candidate, aiming to bring my libertarian principles to the national stage.\n\nPolitical Platform and Vision\n\nMy political platform is built on the pillars of personal liberty, economic freedom, and pragmatic governance. I advocate for significant tax cuts, reduction in public spending, and the dismantling of unnecessary regulations that stifle entrepreneurship and innovation. My vision includes a reformed welfare system focused on empowering individuals through work incentives rather than dependency.\n\nOn social issues, I am a staunch defender of civil liberties. I support policies that protect freedom of speech, privacy rights, and individual autonomy.\n\nProspects\n\nMy blend of professional expertise and libertarian principles positions me as a transformative candidate within Reform UK. As I step onto the national stage, my vision for a leaner, more responsive government resonates with an increasing number of voters disillusioned with traditional political offerings. I am not just a candidate; I am part of a movement for a freer, more prosperous Britain.",

        "statement_to_voters": "A Bit About Me:  I am a born and bred Brummie; I come proudly from a working-class family who have worked hard to provide stability and opportunity. I think family values should be at the heart of decision making as government decisions affect all our families. I am 21 years old and I am studying Accountancy and Finance at University whilst holding down a job. Since I was 16, I have been working in hospitality and retail and greatly understand what it is like to work a real job. It’s gruelling! It’s why I believe firmly we should make work pay!\n\nI have always been disappointed with those in office who have absolutely zero clue what it is like in the real world, who have never experienced hard-ship or had to work the daily grind to make ends meet. I came to the conclusion that no one really represents me or the working class, so I thought why not me?\n\nI hope many of you can relate and feel a similar conviction. I hope to advocate for the following things and hope you too might feel as I do!\n\nSelf-Sustainability: As a nation we have a history of paving the way in innovation and manufacturing. It seems we have forgotten our roots! We have become overly reliant on letting other countries provide for us in terms of energy, fuel and food. I think it is vital to support our British farmers and source locally. This would cut importing costs and provide jobs nationally. It would also lower our carbon footprint as we wouldn’t ferry produce over from overseas! It is essential we invest in ourselves!\n\nEnergy: Can you believe we rely on foreign powers for our energy? I can’t! Our energy bills are utterly through the roof. Families shouldn’t have to choose between eating and heating their homes. Reform UK would utilise our own gas and oil resources, which would reduce our reliance on foreign energy and drive prices down. This would also help create more jobs within the UK. A win-win situation, something that can be and therefore must be achieved!\n\nBBC Licensing: Why should we be forced to pay for their endeavours? We aren’t mandated to pay for Netflix… its optional. Other channels fund themselves via advertising, why can’t the BBC? They are not an essential service and should not be treated as such.\n\nTax: Hold on don’t run away yet! I know it’s the subject everybody loves to hate, however it affects all of us. Both how it is spent and how much comes out of our pockets. Fun fact: did you know last year the government racked in a whopping £788.6 BILLION! (just check the UK Gov website) With such a huge quantity of money so much could be done to improve our public sectors!\n\nIn April 2020 minimum wage was just £8.72 p/h, whereas in April 2024 minimum wage has risen to £11.44. Minimum wage has risen by 31.2% in the last 4 years; however the Tax-free band is still at £12,570.00 meaning whilst it looks like more money is being received… it isn’t. Effectively we are just paying more taxes. I would strongly advocate for the policy to raise the tax-free threshold to £20,000 and proportionately expand the tax bands. The average salary in the UK is £33,000. Having £20,000 tax exempt would save the average Brit roughly £2000 per year!\n\nPS I am always open to suggestions and ideas please feel free to get in touch.\n\nLet’s all make society just that little bit better!",

He currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer for online advertising company, AdTech. He was Dorset Regional Coordinator for Brexit-supporting campaign group, Leavers of Britain, and later stood on a Clean Brexit ticket as an Independent candidate in the 2019 General Election.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nAston was born on 23 March 1981 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and moved with his family to Berkshire in 1986. He was privately educated at Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, and read Computer Science at the University of Southampton. While at university, he was not politically active.\n\nHe held a number of jobs in the technology sector. He currently serves as Chief Technology Officer for AdTech, a company that supplies online publishers with access to search engine advertising. Aston also runs a brand that manufactures bicycle accessories.\n\nPolitical career\n\nHaving previously been active in grassroots campaigning for Brexit, Aston stood unsuccessfully as an Independent candidate in the Bournemouth East constituency in 2019. \n\nIn June 2024, Aston was selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Reform UK in Bournemouth West, after the previous candidate was deselected for comments made on social media.\n\nPolitical views\n\nForeign affairs\n\nWriting in June 2024, Aston described UK foreign policy as \"a hawkish and immoral litany of failure\", explaining that, \"In light of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine, there needs to be a complete re-evaluation of how the UK engages with the world.\"\n\nRole of the state\n\nWriting on X, Aston said, \"The State is an inefficient, coercive, necessary evil. I favour a small state, with governance focussing on avoiding tragedy-of-the-commons-style outcomes.\"\n\nEuropean Union\n\nA strong Eurosceptic, Aston was deeply involved in the British effort to leave the European Union. He has described the EU as, \"the Liberal Democrats, but you can't unelect them.”\n\nMigration policy\n\nOn migration, Aston believes that net migration numbers need to be radically reduced, along with the introduction of strict entry requirements and restrictions on chain migration. Writing on X he said, \"With around 1.2 million new arrivals each year, current UK migration policy is unsustainable and unwanted by the overwhelming majority of British people. Immigration is a top issue this election cycle; we need a radical rethink.\"\n\nSpeech\n\nOn the topic of speech rights, Aston said on X in June 2024, \"Speech rights in the UK have been successively undermined by well-intentioned legislation designed to protect minority groups. The inalienable right to express oneself freely, without intervention from the state, is an important pillar of a robust democracy and this must, definitionally, include speech that others find offensive or even abhorrent. The law should be changed to ensure that Britons are able to express themselves without fear of state sanction.\"\n\nThe economy\n\nAn admirer of Austrian economics, Aston believes trade friction should be reduced by eliminating tariffs where possible, streamlining cross-border VAT reconciliation, and simplifying the tax regime. Writing on X, he said, \"The UK is languishing under an oversized state. Taxation is too high. Regulation is too burdensome. Planning policy is too corrupt. Trade is too encumbered. The British Government has priced domestic workers out of the competition for jobs in an increasingly globalised marketplace, leading to a spiral of decline. Reform has an economic plan to reduce taxation, cut waste, and reduce the size of the state; and I would support this. As part of a drive to increase the competitiveness of the UK, net zero CO2 targets must be abandoned in favour of ensuring a plentiful supply of cheap energy. Housing costs must be reduced by cutting migration to net zero (and I would advocate going further still on this issue) and incentivising house building to improve supply. A preferential trade arrangement must be struck at the earliest opportunity with the USA, in order to offset the increased trade friction with the EU post-Brexit. I would lobby for the wider removal of tariffs and the configuration of a reduced-cost VAT arrangement with the EU, in order to improve the efficiency of trade.\"\n\nControversy\n\nAntisemitism row\n\nIn late June 2024, the Conservative Party candidate for Bournemouth West, Sir Conor Burns, accused Aston of being antisemitic based on alleged historic social media posts. Aston released a statement saying, \"[Sir Conor Burns'] allegation that I am antisemitic is false. I do not ascribe coherent political aims to an entire ethnic group; that would be utterly absurd on its face, and I repudiate any such suggestion.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nAston lives near Boscombe Pier and has maintained a residence in Bournemouth since 2003. He is a competitive cyclist.",

I particularly enjoy local traditions, including the common ridings which are a great and unique feature of this beautiful area.\n\nWhy I am standing for Reform\n\nI joined Reform as I felt none of the current parties were working in the interest of the public and were just coming up with the same old ideas and policies. Nor were they supporting traditional British and Scottish values. I was particularly annoyed at the neglect of the farming industry by successive governments. I feel it is so important that we produce our own food. Everyone needs to eat!!\n\nWhat Reform can do for the Borders\n\nNet Zero policies and too much red tape has damaged our farming industry. Reform wants farmers with farms under 500 Ha to be able to manage their own land the way they know best. We also want to encourage more young people into farming.\n\nThere is a severe lack of affordable housing for Borderers. Local housing associations are under increasing pressure from people looking for homes. I would like to help young people remain in the rural areas in which they grew up by encouraging them to take up a trade to help build and restore homes as well as build their own future and that of the Borders. Reform UK Scotland’s small business policies will encourage new entrepreneurs to help regenerate Border Businesses and generate more jobs.\n\nThe NHS is the biggest employer in the Borders but there is a severe shortage of medical staff. Reform will bring people back into NHS frontline medicine by putting them on zero basic rate tax for three years, and writing off their student loans after 10 years of NHS service or pro rata depending on length of service.",

I have lived in Kearsley all my life and in 2018 I was a co-founder of Farnworth and Kearsley First, which was formed by a group of residents who were fed up of being let down by our local politicians and watching a once great area fall into decline. I joined Reform UK in 2022 out of sheer frustration over the treatment of our towns by the ruling parties. We have had a Labour MP for 12 years and seen no improvement or fight.\n\nI have strong connections in Bolton South and Walkden through work, friends and family.\n\nMy working career has always been in the care/charity sectors. Being a lifelong learner and passionate about social justice, I have a deep sense of empathy for the needs of some of the most vulnerable in society and can identify with many people who are let down under the current system. Working with grass roots has given me the ability to see first-hand the impact our government has had on working families. We have all felt the negative impact of lack of access to GP's, NHS, housing, inflation (IE tax rises, energy rises), failing education and with no sign of improvement.\n\nAny politician that stands proud to cut the red ribbon when they are announcing another food bank opening, should hang their heads in shame. It is for these reasons why I joined Reform, as I worry about what kind of future my grandchildren will have.\n\nI am not a career politician; I am just a working-class lass from the North. I am doing this because I want better for our towns and future generations.\n\nIf I am blessed to be gifted your vote I promise to fight for improvement and be your voice.",

Most notable of which is the collapse of civic pride and the overall decline of standards at all levels of society. Local government is utterly dysfunctional and combined with the incompetence in Westminster since Blair took charge, national decline has accelerated.\r\n\r\nMany of the problems of Bexhill and Battle are mirrored across the country and need a fix at the national level. That being said, I am more than aware of the heinous development of North Eye and the lack of social housing in the area – generating a needless homelessness problem.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury is the impossibility of getting GP and dental appointments. Too much money is being frittered away on incompetent NHS bureaucratic failures. Millions are being wasted locally on hiring HR and diversity officers that do nothing but increase waiting lists. Mass immigration is, of course, one of the primary causes of the crisis in both housing and health. Our party will deal with this as the top priority.\r\n\r\nCompounding this are the stagnant incomes of law abiding, tax paying citizens of the constituency facing huge cost of living increases. Crime is off the charts, and crime falls hardest on the poorest people. Our police force does nothing to arrest this collapse, too obsessed with enforcing woke ideology that the stupidity of the Human Rights and “Equality” Acts have engendered.\r\n\r\nMoving down our long hitlist are the utility companies from rail to gas to water. Executives have been extracting cash for shareholders while remunerating themselves like masters of the universe. I have direct experience with dealing with overcompensated boards, ousting their ineffective members. Recently the area was hit with a 3-day outage of water, while I am astounded by the level of flooding that still persists in the area. The lack of accountability is mind blowing.\r\n\r\nEducation is yet another catastrophe to add to the litany of failures of successive governments. Good school places are hard to guarantee in the area as well as a clear fall in academic standards: the DfE does nothing to address the insane progressive ideologies that they have allowed into classrooms at the expense of the 3 R’s.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with any or all the above and want to see REAL change, please lend me your vote. Better still, if you have the time and money, consider joining Reform UK. We are a small party and lack the resources and infrastructure that the big two failures have built up over decades. Level the playing field and have a true voice of knowledge and integrity as your MP for Bexhill and Battle!",

        "name": "Robert Reaney",
        "statement_to_voters": "I am a fifty-six-year-old businessman from Chesterfield, married with one grown up son. I was born and bred in Sheffield and have working class roots, which I am proud of. It gave me a firm appreciation of the few things we have and taught me the value of a good honest day’s work and getting stuck in, since we had little other choice. There is definitely no silver spoon element here. Everything we have in life is what my wife and I have worked hard for and continue to do so to this day. I have an interest in history and read quite widely.\n\nMy early working years, between 1987 and 2004, were in finance. I worked for the Prudential Assurance Co, The Midland Bank/HSBC, and then two large accountancy practices in Sheffield servicing business clients. So while I do not claim to be an expert in any of these areas, I believe that those years gave me a decent look behind the scenes at how money works. I have an insight into the world of insurance, savings and investments, banking, accountancy, taxation and how businesses run in general.\n\nThis is not bad groundwork for any aspiring politician, I guess, and one that gives me perhaps more experience than someone who has just popped out of university with a degree in rocket science. From 2004, I have been running my own vintage motorcycle business. It’s a hobby gone mad for me and has been lots of fun. I have met some quite remarkable characters and learnt an awful lot about our automotive history. More importantly I have learnt from hard experience what it takes to survive in business.\n\nBeing self-employed means you have no sick pay, no holiday pay, no pension plan or cushy benefits such as a company car, medical insurance or an annual Christmas bonus. If you make a mistake in business, you pay for it yourself. This translates to being able to work hard all month and some months finding yourself worse off financially than when you started.\n\nHave I had months where I‘ve lost money? Absolutely, and when you’re paying personally for waste or mistakes, you learn quick. When your own cash is on the line it is a fine master. It is something many employees never experience, and I feel do not perhaps fully appreciate.\n\nBusiness has also shown me the harsh reality of red tape, of accounts to be done, of VAT returns to be completed, of health and safety, of rates, bills and local government interference, etc. Frankly, small businesses are deluged with hassle. Making a profit is the least of it sometimes.\n\nSo what have I seen during these last four decades working? Well, the 1987 stock market crash was up close and personal for me. I witnessed the Millennium bug scam unfold followed by the tech stock bubble bursting. I lived through the 2008 banking crises which triggered the recession and the ‘austerity years’ (have they finished?).\n\nWe all lived through the surreal lockdowns of the pandemic and most recently the cost-of-living crisis, where everything seems to have doubled in price regardless of reason. It has all been a remarkable financial roller coaster. Working to survive can be hard enough, but when outside forces collude to make all our lives so much harder, I’ve found myself gnashing my teeth in frustration with everyone else. Which brings me nicely to politics\n\nJust like you, I’m sick and tired of powerlessly watching car-crash politics in the UK along with ambulance-chasing politicians who leap on the latest disaster to score some minor political point. I am tired of the weekly Punch and Judy show in Westminster where seemingly ‘detached from reality’ members score political points off each other across the dispatch box, while the world outside merrily goes to the dogs.\n\nI am tired of hearing about (and more pertinently paying for) London's problems or the seeing the country's sole reliance on the one great industry... the city/banking, etc. I am tired of seeing all the other industries being left to whither on the vine. Fishing has been parleyed off, farming is on its knees, mining has gone, steel has gone, shipbuilding has gone, the automotive industry has been sold off or is a shadow of its former self – industry of all types has been actively run down. Even the utilities and trains have been flogged off and run into the ground. We are now apparently just a ‘service economy’.\n\nPolitically, we have had people shouting at each other across the dispatch box in Westminster since Oliver Cromwell established the place in 1650. I have to ask in all seriousness, where has it actually got us? The industrial revolution did not start in Westminster, nor the age of empire, nor the age of remarkable technologies, and even in terms of law-making... how much further on are we than the Magna Carta? All of these started outside the M25 in that strange wider world known as Great Britain, which is where I would like to focus.\n\nIt is time in my life to start giving a little back and I believe I can add a little value, for what it is worth. Like you, I am sick of not being listened too. I fall down the same potholes as you, pay the same taxes as you and struggle, like you, to survive. I am listening to your problems because I share them. Let’s focus on local issues and build jobs and a brighter future here together. What I am seeing and hearing from Reform UK tackles many of these issues. Their policies make sense to me. Common sense. \n\nI would be pleased to bring my years of experience to bear on our shared difficulties and listen to your problems. I have my feet on the ground and my head is most definitely not in the clouds. I know that all our lives can be made much better now and I want to pass on a far brighter future to our kids than we are presently on track to do.\n\nI believe that it can be done and the choice to roll the dice and take that gamble will be yours come election day. You can choose the same old show or just maybe be brave and give the outsider a fighting chance for once. What have you got to lose? Another lost decade, or a real chance to start fixing the problems with a local representative you can relate too and is really listening.\n\nThis is who I am, and I invite you to back me to help Bolsover progress into the 2020s.",

Single and unsupported, I had to prioritise the care of my children, their development and education. I know what it is like to struggle “to make ends meet”.\n\nIn pursuit of greater financial stability, I undertook a three years part time course in accounting, attempting to further my career prospects.\n\nThe government institutions in the country where I grew up, Albania, exercise an extreme level of control over civil society and liberties. I am one of many who felt they had no choice other than to flee and seek safety, escaping the armed conflict, violence and serious public disorder there. I do not want to stand by and watch the UK potentially going down the same road.\n\nI was a part-time care assistant with Springfield Care, before gaining a placement as an accounting administrator with ALB Ltd.\n\nI then secured a job with my current employer, Barclays Bank as financial advisor in 2017.\n\nI believe this Conservative government has badly mishandled Brexit, unnecessarily ruined the economy and damaged, particularly children’s mental health, with its repeated lockdowns policy.\n\nIt has clearly failed to control illegal migration, failed to “Stop The Boats”, compounding its disastrous financial management of the pandemic. Its obsessive pursuit of Net Zero policies, based on a false Climate Emergency, has led to the current Cost of Living crisis, and if allowed to continue, will lead to the export of our remaining manufacturing jobs abroad.  \n\nI believe a central bank digital currency would provide our government with complete control over every aspect of our lives, and that no government can, or should, be trusted with this level of power.\n\nThe implications and consequences of Net Zero-related projects such as “15 minute cities”, have never been properly placed before the voting public for open debate.\n\nThe public has rightly lost confidence in the current government, and fears the prospect of the Labour government, which undoubtedly will escalate the current awful situation, into an even more disastrous one.\n\nThese are just a few of the reasons I joined Reform UK.

I’ve worked as a Procurement and Commercial Manager for 35 years, mostly within manufacturing companies in West Yorkshire.\n\nI have not previously been involved in politics at a local or national level but felt the need to do something and offer people an alternative from the 2 main parties who both appear to be committed to imposing their politically correct agendas on the country whilst restricting the rights of ordinary citizens to voice their concerns.\n\nMy main political interests are in encouraging economic growth in the North through business incentives and investment in transport infrastructure and manufacturing. I have no time for net zero, gender debates or other minority issues that seem to have distracted our political class and mainstream media over the last few decades. My main concern is for the silent majority, those who have contributed to society, worked hard and done the right things in life but have seen their living standards dragged down by high taxes, unnecessary government spending and poor immigration control.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy Park Runs, dog walking and motorcycling.\n\nHoping you vote for Reform UK and help put a stop to the slow and unnecessary decline of the UK, its economy, its historic freedoms and its culture.",

I went to the local state primary school and learnt to read, write, and arithmetic in French, alongside my Belgian classmates. In 1979 we moved back to England and I completed my scholarity in the local primary and comprehensive schools. At university I read Chemical Engineering, and I have worked as a Chemical Engineer throughout my whole career. This has included living and working in France and the Netherlands, as well as work in the Republic of Ireland and Sweden. Since 2019 I have run my own engineering consulting business.\n\nI am happily married to my wonderful wife, we have three beautiful children plus two fantastic cats. We live in Barton under Needwood in the adjoining constituency of Lichfield. Our youngest was born in 2016 in Queen’s Hospital in Burton. All our children attend the local primary and comprehensive schools in Barton. I am a confirmed member of the Church of England and worship regularly at St James in Barton.\n\nI have always been proud to be English and British, and have been concerned over the future of our beloved country throughout my life. In the 2010, 2015 and 2017 general elections I stood in the Constituency of North East Derbyshire as the UKIP candidate. In the 2016 Referendum I campaigned extensively for Leave.\n\nMy motivation for standing in the General Election is to provide the good people of Burton and Uttoxeter with the opportunity to vote for a Reform UK candidate. The Conservative government has betrayed the British people on immigration.  In 2022 alone, over 1.2 million newcomers settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Conservative government has also presided over an explosion in energy, housing and food prices, a national debt that since 2010 has trebled, an NHS that costs over £500m a day but which can’t provide timely GP appointments, taxation at a 70-year high, the HS2 mega-money pit and an army smaller than at any time in the last 200 hundred years. Not forgetting the boats invasion across the English Channel, which the Conservative government encourages by picking up the illegal migrants mid-Channel and ferrying them to our shores, rather than simply returning them to French ones, as Reform UK would.\n\nI hope very much that the patriotic residents of the Burton and Uttoxeter constituency will give thought to lending their votes to me, their Reform UK candidate, in the General Election on 4th July.  Reform UK will implement a “one in, one out” immigration policy, and focus instead on rebuilding and expanding our manufacturing industries, and supporting our farmers. Reform UK will raise the tax thresholds to help the low paid and get more British people back to work.  Reform UK will end the IR35 persecution of the self-employed and reduce rates on high street businesses. Reform UK will focus on producing cheap, affordable, Sovereign British energy for consumers and our industry.\n\nThis means fracking and rolling out at pace the Small Modular Nuclear Reactors that Derby-based Rolls Royce have developed.  Reform UK will actively support our car manufacturers such as Toyota up the road in Burnaston, instead of banning the sale of the cars they produce.\n\nPlease get in contact with me by email (above) if you would like to help in any way or share with me your thoughts on how Reform UK could promote the wellbeing of Burton and Uttoxeter and its residents and businesses.",

My aim is to fight for the betterment of everyone in Brent East by controlling illegal immigration effectively, reducing taxation for those who need it most and pursuing smart greening of the area without its bankrupting everyone through massive green taxation of your fuel bills.\n\nMy focus will be to slash government waste which will give more funds to lift the income tax start point to £20,000 freeing many from having to pay income tax.  I shall fight to reduce energy taxes by £500 per year for every household and shall support small businesses by allowing you to keep more of your hard earned profits.  I will use my experience in business to reform the inefficient processes of civil service departments in order to save that money for the income tax reductions and improve services at the same time. Efficiency leads to better effectiveness and many have now experienced how slowly some government bodies operate – not least the NHS.\n\nReform UK will freeze all non-essential immigration but will allow visas for essential skills such as social care.  By allowing net immigration equal to twice the population of Brent each year, the housing costs will continue to rise inexorably. I will then fight to reform the planning system to allow easier development of brownfield sites to provide more housing.\n\nI am proud of Britain which now needs to Reform to help those who are its backbone, both economically and in their British sense of fair play.",

Norfolk is where I raised a family, and despite not always being able to be home in the early days due to work commitments, the benefits of rural Norfolk life for my family outweighed the convenience of city living and easy access to the motorway system.\n\nMy work has taken me to many countries, some quite challenging, but faith has been a source of strength in times of difficulty. Fortunately, today my life is more stable, and I cherish my home life with my wife who has worked in a children's nursery for 36 years, finding it incredibly rewarding to see generations grow up within the same industry.\n\nThe question that I believe most of your readers would want to ask is why I have decided to stand for selection in the next General Election. The reason is simple – I am concerned for my grandchildren and their prospects. Over the last 50 years, our government has focused only on short-term goals, leaving others to deal with the consequences of their actions. Issues such as the budget deficit, energy, housing, the NHS, defence, immigration, and more have been neglected, with no government fully addressing these challenges regardless of how long they are in power.\n\nBut this bureaucratic governmental neglect has filtered its down into our local government and the services offered and maintained by them, Planning, roads, road safety and Flooding again only to name a few\n\nIt is this short-sighted approach in Westminster that has led me to stand for election. The decisions being made now or proposed as alternatives could have a detrimental impact on the next generation, potentially turning us into a third-world nation stripped of valuable assets.\n\nA future where the population reaches 100 million, with a high unemployment rate among university graduates due to advancements in technology, and those who do work are pushed into poverty due to supporting a benefit culture.\n\nOur country will not remain the Great Britain we once knew, nor will it uphold its Christian values. Therefore, I believe we need a change in direction before the short-sightedness of traditional tax-and-spend parties or the reckless actions of the Tories and Labour lead us into an uncertain future. It is important to realise that there are more than just two options; the choice lies with you and not with what the media or political parties dictate.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story, and if you wish to join me on this journey, you can easily find me in your community or online.",

Britain deserves better. Reform UK offer a proper genuine alternative to the current two-party system.\n\nI believe that Britain cannot sustain the massive immigration numbers that we have seen over the last few years. I believe that the race towards net zero is hitting the poorest in society first and ultimately will lead to us all being colder and poorer. I believe in a low regulation low taxation economy that encourages free market economics, in a society where the rights of criminals do not trump the rights of victims, and where children should be protected and the elderly respected.\n\nWe managed to find £37 billion to pay for a failed test track and trace system during Covid, yet fail to adequately fund our NHS, Social Care, Education or Criminal Justice system. Taxation is the highest it has been in over 70 years, and government overreach is out of control. This is all wrong. Westminster seems to have forgotten that the government exists because of the people; the people do not exist because of the government.\n\nWhen I discovered Reform UK, I found a party that shared many of my views. Standing as a political candidate was never on my “to do” list, but circumstances change.\n\nI applied and was accepted to stand for Reform UK at the next General Election, giving the people of Brentwood and Ongar an alternative to the current two-party system.

I refuse to accept this as the new norm, we need zero tolerance on knife crime. We need a greater number of police officers and greater visibility of these officers in public.\n\nThe removal of wokeness from the police force and a re-calibration of their priorities is paramount. No more ‘thought policing’, no more time wasting on supposed hate crimes for mis-gendering, no more trolling of social media looking for ‘no crime, hate crimes’. We are facing serious social discontent and we need a strong and respected police force to show what is acceptable and to keep us safe. A lean towards proper old school policing is required.\n\nWhen it comes to planning issues, I’ve determined that the Tory party tends to favour developers over the will of the local residents and the Labour party tends to stifle business. I envisage a balance somewhere in the middle where all should benefit from new developments, especially when it comes to affordable housing. Affordable housing needs to be sustainable, not on the green belt and not suppressed by the absurd charge to Net Zero. It should be the norm for new developments and not just a small percentage used as a box ticking exercise for developers to get around legislation.\n\nI am standing for Reform UK as it is the only Party which represents the man in the street. Reform UK’s policies are founded on common sense, free from the restrictions imposed by a left or right political ideology. A party that champions British family values, safeguards our history, our heritage and culture. The only party that puts the UK and its citizens first.",

I returned home from my job in the South Pacific for the election. \n\nOver the past 14 years, the Conservatives have delivered endless broken promises. Far from taking back control, they have only continued to lose control. We have spiralling national debt, millions more people waiting for health treatment, higher taxes, and out of control immigration.\n\nAn incompetent, exhausted, and arrogant government that struggles to get anything done has left a legacy of an underperforming economy, wrecked public services, run-down and foreign-owned infrastructure, and a diminished international reputation. The Conservatives squandered the potential benefits of Brexit and struck a bad deal with the EU. The Labour party can not be trusted with a re-negotiation.\n\nLabour is not the answer to the country’s long list of problems.

I was born in North-East Bristol, have lived in Easton, Eastville, and Fishponds where I now live. I'm married with one daughter, and have many interests including singing, cycling, motorbikes, and old British cars.\n\nI’m standing for parliament because I am appalled at how badly Broken Britain is being run and I want to see the whole of government reformed. We have a non-functioning political system that has become remote and disconnected from ordinary people, and seems to be run by an elite managerial class who despise us and disrespect our own needs and cares.\n\nSomething needs to change. Only a political revolution will do it, and only Reform UK is interested in making that happen.\n\nImmigration\n\nBritain has always welcomed people from other lands, races, and cultures and has benefitted from that over the centuries. But immigration has grown too fast in the last decade and far beyond what the country can cope with. Over one million immigrants arrived here last year and another million and more will come this year. Where will they live? The government hasn’t built enough new houses for them or hired enough new doctors or dentists.\n\nWhere will they get health care – and where will you?\n\nIt cannot go on. Annual immigration must be cut down from a million to a few thousand and only Reform UK do this, because all the others want it to continue.\n\nTaxation\n\nTories have followed Labour in raising taxation to an all-time high, and everyone pays it. Adults pay for energy, children pay VAT on sweets, the retired pay it on their workplace pensions and the dead face inheritance tax.\n\nTaxation is high because the government does too much, and what it does, it does badly. They interfere with everything and make a mess of everything. If you want lower taxation, so you can choose how you spend your own money, the government has to spend less.

        "statement_to_voters": "The people of Broxtowe have a clear choice at the general election on July 4th. They can either vote to prolong the dying two-party system that has taken them for granted for decades, or they can make their vote actually count towards meaningful change by voting for the only party that dreams of a prosperous, safe, and successful Britain: Reform UK.\n\nMy name is Joseph, I’ve been a part of the local community for nearly a year now - long before I planned to run as an MP - and I’m running to be Broxtowe’s community champion in Parliament for Reform UK.\n\nThis election is the best opportunity Broxtowe and Britain have had in decades - perhaps even centuries - to lead a citizen-led democratic revolt against the useless party placemen that have been failing us for so long in Westminster. In this election, there is no real difference between the two traditional main parties. With them, you have a choice between unsustainable levels of (often illegal) net migration; fewer freedoms and ludicrously high taxes in blue, or the exact same in red.\n\nThis means that for the first time in decades, there is an opportunity to change the Westminster political system, despite the unfair FPTP electoral system, because the “Conservatives” have lost the legitimacy of their classic attack line “Vote Reform, get Labour”. After 14 years of “Conservative” Government, voters have woken up to the fact that the Tories are not just indistinguishable from Labour - but are even worse.\n\nLabour’s response to Tory incompetence is to keep a low profile and let the Tories do their job for them, without demonstrating that they are ready to lead the country. They don’t have a coherent plan for Broxtowe or our nation because they wrongly believe they are entitled to your vote - just because they have slightly more credibility than a party that has broken all of their promises to the British people.\n\nThe alternative to this endless cycle of failure is a vote for Reform UK. A vote for Reform UK stands for real change and common sense. Reform UK’s ambitious plan for the country will:\n\nMake work pay: Reform UK will increase the personal allowance to £20,000, saving every worker £1500; abolish business rates for small high street businesses and reform the benefit system to get 1 million people back in work.\n\nFix the NHS: Reform UK will eliminate NHS waiting lists within two years by freezing the basic rate tax on NHS and social care staff for 3 years; end the training cap on medical students and stop brain drain by writing off the student debt of medical students who work in our NHS for 10 years.\n\nSecure our future: Our infrastructure simply cannot handle any more positive net migration. Competition for housing means prices have risen dramatically, making it impossible for young working-class and even middle-income households to get on the housing ladder. Additionally, our district’s infrastructure has a very finite capacity for new housing. The best way to solve this crisis, further reduce NHS waiting lists, and protect access to public services is Reform UK’s plan to freeze net migration for at least 5 years.\n\nOur opponents will try to claim this policy is based on absurd claims of “racism” when in reality this policy is based on pragmatism and undeniable reality. After 14 years of broken Tory promises, we do not have the infrastructure or capacity for positive net migration in Broxtowe. It won’t stop everyone from coming to the country, it just means that we operate a reasonable and sensible one in, one out immigration policy.\n\nThere is so much more too - you can read about additional policies and our full funding plan at https://www.reformparty.uk/our-contract-with-you\n\nBroxtowe deserves to have a bold representative returned to parliament to get results. I’m the only local candidate in this election with any chance of winning. I know the local community and I’ve spent well over £1000 of my own money supporting local businesses in Broxtowe. From crime to the cost of living, I understand firsthand the difficulties faced by residents in our area. I’ve previously worked in two key sectors: teaching and hospitality. Furthermore, I have experience volunteering as a Cub Scout leader, and as a camp and residential leader for various educational groups.\n\nBroxtowe has an opportunity for a new start on the 4th of July. Make no mistake, we can win here, but we can only win with your support. Put an X next to Joseph on July 4th to change Broxtowe and the whole country for the better.\n\nP.S. Email jwr.reform@gmail.com to help contribute to the campaign, your help is urgently needed if we want to capitalise on this winning opportunity.",

I moved into the Oil and Gas sector in 1989, working on and offshore in the UK and overseas. I continue to work part time in this industry.\n\nI have experience of the property sector having been involved in the construction and renovation of residential properties. I continue to work as a landlord and appreciate the difficulties which people now have with the purchase / rental of their homes; this given the parlous state of the housing market.\n\nI believe all people whether of high, low or middle income must have aspiration for family and themselves. We must all have equal access to the resources of education and opportunity so that those aspirations can be achieved.\n\nThe economy must grow in order that an increasing population be given the financial freedom through work, to meet its public spending requirements. We are in a situation where the changing demographic of an increasingly aged and immigration fuelled population overtakes the countries current growth expectations; without radical reform in all areas this is unsustainable.\n\nIt is paramount that we must greatly increase financing of the health and social care sectors so that our endemic ageing population is given the services it so deserves. This increased spending must however come from reform of current financial structures, not by injecting yet more good cash after bad.\n\nWhilst immigration has, historically been a necessary and valued addition to the British population, its exponential increase over the past 20 years is unsustainable from both a financial and socially cohesive perspective.\n\nZero net migration must be the goal and has to be achieved for the good of the British economy, its workforce and social equilibrium.\n\nDepartmental waste must be slashed in order that government budgets are sufficient to provide fit for purpose financing of the Defence, Education and Welfare sectors.\n\nThe Health and Social Care budget must be ring fenced at pre-pandemic levels and taken out of government control. Our NHS is on life support and must be resuscitated by different management as a not for profit business by those with the skills gained from our most successful industries.\n\nThe agriculture and fishing industries must be resurrected in order that British food feeds British people.\n\nBritish manufacturing industries must be competitive against all foreign competition, with a home energy sector fuelling that support. Britain can once again lead the world. We still have the workforce and skills but they have been supressed for far too long by political weakness and incompetence.\n\nChange is VITAL and it starts at the forthcoming general election.

I was manager for both UK and Norway for the French toiletries company L’ Herbier de Provence.\n\nI moved from retail into media as Business Development Manager for Humana international headhunting at executive level across UK & Europe during the dotcom boom for the telecom industry.

I joined the Brexit party in 2016 and campaigned tirelessly for them all over the country. I stood as a Brexit Party PPC for Chichester until we were asked to stand down in order for Boris Johnson to pull the wool over our eyes. For the past seven years I have watched in horror as all Brexit opportunities voted for by 17.4 million people have been neglected and purposely undermined.\n\nI’m not afraid to challenge the mediocrity in Westminster and will fight for Chichester‘s voice in Parliament. This is a once in a lifetime vote to save Great Britain. The Conservatives have taken us to financial collapse, public services, energy and health sectors are in severe crisis. We are facing global conflict and our armed forces are at breaking point. We rely on the French providing us energy while the French rely on us taking care of their excess immigration at a huge cost, not only financially but socially and culturally.\n\nThe Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have no idea how to govern, they all want to drag us back into the EU where everything would be done for them. We would again be dictated to by unelected bureaucrats at a huge cost. The Liberal Democrats would take us into the single market. The Reform Party have put together a team of astute business candidates. We are not career politicians, most are capable business people with proven track records.\n\nReform will rebuild Great Britain by investing in industry like the British steel we were once so proud of, nuclear reactors & improving the grid. Reform will scrap HS2 saving £25+ billion, scrap Net Zero & also invest in our armed forces. These are just a few reasons why I am standing in Chichester for Reform.\n\nReform UK will secure Britain’s future as a free, proud and independent sovereign nation.

As a proud UK citizen who has chosen to live, work, and raise my family in Wales, I consider this country the best in the world.\n\nLike many, I would prefer to live a quiet life. However, the recent news of 685,000 net migrants to the UK for the second consecutive year has compelled me to act. We've also seen troubling headlines about crimes committed by immigrants, which we are often encouraged to overlook. This situation poses significant challenges for the working class, who face increased competition for low-skilled jobs, and for young people struggling to find affordable housing. Meanwhile, big businesses profit from a surplus of cheap labour.\n\nThe only party addressing these concerns is Reform.\n\nWe need tighter immigration controls. This is not about racism; it’s about practicality. Immigrants, regardless of their background, require housing, healthcare, and public services. Currently, there simply aren’t enough resources to go around. Our families and fellow citizens must take priority. Prioritizing UK citizens should be a common-sense approach.\n\nAs a reserved and polite Briton, there comes a time when one must take a stand for family and country. That time is now.\n\nHaving experienced different cultures, I can confidently say that British culture, with its democratic values, equal rights for women, and freedom of speech and religion, is worth protecting. Everyone coming to the UK must respect these principles. No religion should be above criticism.\n\nWhile immigration has brought benefits to the UK, there can be too much of a good thing. Like overindulging in pizza, excessive immigration is causing cultural indigestion.\n\nThis is a local issue for Caerphilly as well. The strain on Treasury funds due to poor-quality immigration means less funding for Wales and Caerphilly. We can only bear so much. Just as you wouldn’t tolerate a guest draining your family’s finances, we must manage our national resources wisely.\n\nTo win in Caerphilly, I need to secure support from half the Tory voters and a third of Labour voters. Regardless of the outcome, every vote for me and Reform sends a message to Westminster: we demand significant cuts to mass immigration.\n\nAfter 25 years of Labour power in Wales, it’s clear they've failed us. They've taken your votes for granted and hold us in contempt. Consider:\n\nThe blanket 20mph speed limit – a disastrous policy.\n\nVaughan Gething’s questionable £200k donation.\n\nWelsh Labour imposing their candidate on Caerphilly without consulting the local party.\n\nIf you’re angry, you have every right to be. Together, we can create a political earthquake. Every vote counts.\n\nVote Reform on July 4th!\n\nThank you for your support.",

My wife and I along with her parents moved to Wales a number of years ago where we had a successful holiday letting business. I live on a smallholding where we farm Soay Sheep, Anglo Nubian Goats and a small number of Cows. I also work in retail management for a Welsh company and my role entails traveling and managing stores all over the Ceredigion area (mostly Lampeter, Aberystwyth and Cardigan) so I’m not a career politician, I’m just someone like you who feels that things need to change and and we need to break the cosy cabals both in Cardiff and Westminster, while offering a genuine alternative to the choke-hold applied by the main two parties.\n\nObviously, being a small holder and knowing many farmers, I will pledge to help the agricultural sector which has been unfairly blamed for many of the issues facing society today and, if elected, I would do all I could to assist these hard-working men and women. I am a firm believer in the \"No Farmers, No Food\" movement and I would strongly oppose any further regulation of farmers or implementation of the Net Zero policies that are crippling both the economy and the country, one household at a time.\n\nFurthermore, working in retail, I am seeing firsthand the effects of the economic mismanagement of the two main parties. It is heartbreaking seeing people having to decide between heating or eating, or watching them try and scrimp and save to get from one salary payment to the next. It is especially frustrating that the Tories are looking to decimate benefits for disabled people while they continue allowing the importation of migrants while paying millions of pounds per day for the privilege.\n\nObviously, my personal vision is aligned with that of the party I stand for, especially where our young people are concerned. We need to help them achieve academically and vocationally as well as support mental health provision in this area which is woefully underfunded and inadequate according to information and case studies I’ve reviewed. Finally, I’m not going to pretend I can fix things on my own and make promises I cannot keep, we’ve all had enough of that from Welsh Labour.

Alarmed by their vision, which reminded me of other European dictatorships, I decided to stand up and be counted. I stood for the Referendum Party in Romford in the 1997 election, and again in the 2001 election. My passion for ensuring that the UK's sovereignty was preserved was the driving force behind my early political involvement.\n\nAfter joining the police force, I was unable to actively participate in politics, but my commitment to public service remained unwavering. In 2013, I left the police force and became active with UKIP. In 2014, I was elected as a councillor and proudly served as Deputy Mayor in 2015-16.

My extensive background in law enforcement and public service equips me with the experience and dedication needed to advocate for our community.\n\nLocal issues and plans\n\nHousing and infrastructure Addressing the pressures of a growing population on local housing, ensuring affordable and quality housing for all, and improving infrastructure to support sustainable growth. Healthcare Improving access to NHS appointments and GP surgeries, ensuring our healthcare system meets the needs of our community. Roads and transportation Enhancing road maintenance, tackling potholes, and improving public transportation to ensure safer and more efficient travel. Energy security Supporting the nuclear industry in Cumbria, including Sellafield, to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply, reduce reliance on imported energy, and create high-quality local jobs. Additional info about Carlisle\n\nCarlisle is a vibrant city with a rich history and a diverse community. As we face the challenges of the future, it is crucial to have leadership that understands the local issues and is committed to addressing them. I am dedicated to working with the people of Carlisle to create a better, more prosperous future for all.\n\nAddressing the strain on Carlisle’s infrastructure\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of our current national landscape, it’s evident that the challenges faced by local communities like Carlisle are significant and growing. Recent data highlights several pressing issues:\n\nGrowing population and immigration\n\nCarlisle has experienced a population growth of 2.3% over the past decade, according to the 2021 Census by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This growth, partly driven by immigration, has put a substantial strain on our local infrastructure. The increased demand for housing, healthcare, and other essential services is palpable.\n\nUnemployment rates\n\nUnemployment remains a concern in Carlisle, with the local job market struggling to keep pace with the growing population. According to the latest figures from the ONS, the unemployment rate in the area underscores the urgent need for effective economic policies and job creation initiatives.\n\nImpact on local services\n\nHousing The rising population has intensified competition for housing, driving up rents and making it more challenging for residents to find affordable homes. Healthcare NHS appointments and GP surgeries are under significant pressure, leading to longer waiting times and reduced accessibility to healthcare services. Education Local schools are facing increased enrolment, straining resources and affecting the quality of education. Infrastructure Roads and public transport systems are struggling to cope with the additional load, resulting in congestion and deterioration of services. The role of government\n\nSuccessive governments have largely ignored the cumulative impact of these pressures on local communities. While large energy corporations report record profits, local services are stretched thin, and many residents find themselves struggling to afford basic necessities. This imbalance is unacceptable and calls for a comprehensive approach to policy reform.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nAs your Reform Party candidate, I am dedicated to addressing these issues through strategic planning and investment in local infrastructure. Our policies will focus on:\n\nControlled Immigration Implementing fair and sustainable immigration policies that consider the capacity of local services and infrastructure. Economic Growth Promoting job creation and supporting local businesses to reduce unemployment. Infrastructure Investment Enhancing housing, healthcare, education, and transportation to meet the needs of our growing community. Energy Security Supporting the nuclear industry in Cumbria to ensure a stable energy supply and create high-quality jobs. Together, we can build a Carlisle that is resilient, prosperous and prepared for the future. It’s time for a government that takes these challenges seriously and works diligently to address them.\n\nSources:\n\nOffice for National Statistics, Census 2021: Carlisle population change GOV.UK, Immigration statistics Let’s work together to bring about the positive changes Carlisle needs.",

My Grandad established the famous Kendall’s Ice-cream factory almost 100 years ago and this family business was managed by my father, Kenneth, until his retirement in 1989.   I have many friends & family still living in the Calder Valley and visit regularly. Calder Valley is a complete fit for me: home is where the heart is! Yorkshire roots and connections are so strong that I married my wife, Sandra, at Halifax registry office in 2019 and had the reception at The Shibden Mill Inn!\n\nFor some time, I have been frustrated and dismayed by the lack of conviction by our current political leaders who are full of empty promises which are completely devoid of any meaningful action. I firmly believe that Reform UK will not only give commitments that make absolute sense, from social and economic points of view, but will absolutely deliver on these promises.\n\nI stand before you now as a passionate advocate for Reform UK, a party dedicated to revitalizing our nation with a clear focus on education, science, and common sense. These pillars are not just the foundation of our policy but are essential for the future prosperity of our country.\n\nEducation: Building a Brighter Future\n\nEducation is my chosen vocation and I have taught Chemistry up to A Level for over 30 years. As such it is a core tenet which I stand upon. Education is the cornerstone of any thriving society. It is through education that we empower our young people, equipping them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. Reform UK believes in an education system that is not only world-class but also accessible to all. We envision a future where our schools are not just places of learning but centres of excellence.\n\nWe propose comprehensive reforms that include increased funding for schools, a stronger emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects, and vocational training that prepares students for the real world. We must ensure that our teachers are well-supported and adequately compensated, recognizing their vital role in shaping the minds of future generations.\n\nBy prioritizing education, we are investing in our most valuable resource: our children. They are the future scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and leaders who will drive our nation forward.\n\nScience: Innovating for Tomorrow\n\nScience and innovation are at the heart of progress. From medical breakthroughs to technological advancements, it is science that propels humanity forward. Reform UK is committed to fostering a culture of innovation and research. We advocate for increased funding for scientific research and development, ensuring that the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation.\n\nWe understand that tackling the challenges of the 21st century—whether it be climate change, public health, or technological disruption—requires a robust commitment to scientific inquiry and evidence-based policymaking. We will work to create an environment where scientists and researchers have the resources and freedom to explore new frontiers and make discoveries that benefit all of humanity.\n\nCommon Sense: Practical Solutions for Real Problems\n\nAt the core of our approach is a commitment to common sense. We believe in practical, straightforward solutions to the problems facing our country. Common sense means cutting through bureaucratic red tape, eliminating wasteful spending, and ensuring that government policies are grounded in reality and serve the best interests of the people.\n\nWe advocate for policies that are not just ideologically sound but also practically effective. Whether it's reforming our healthcare system to ensure it meets the needs of every citizen, creating a fair and sustainable immigration policy, or ensuring that our economy remains competitive on the global stage, we approach each issue with a clear-eyed focus on what works.\n\nA Call to Action\n\nThe future of our nation depends on the choices we make today. Reform UK is committed to building a stronger, smarter, and fairer society. We believe in an education system that prepares our young people for the challenges of tomorrow, in scientific advancement that drives progress and innovation, and in common sense policies that address the real needs of our citizens.\n\nTogether, we can create a future where opportunity is available to all, where innovation flourishes, and where common sense prevails. I urge you to join us in this mission. Support Reform UK and be a part of the movement to transform our nation for the better.",

Whilst in service I volunteered to take part in the toughest team competition in the world, the Royal Navy Field Gun Competition. After many years of competition, and inevitably, injuries, I was medically discharged from service.\n\nWith my maritime engineering experience, I moved to Dubai to become a ship repair manager, project managing the fixing, rebuilding and dry docking of some of the largest vessels that sail our seas, including rigs and offshore platforms. I have since set up quite a few businesses in the hospitality industry, until I retired in 2023.\n\nThough I am not married, I am a family man with a 14-year-old son.\n\nI am a wholehearted supporter of Reform UK, if elected naturally the policies closest to my heart would be those dealing with the Armed Services.

The list goes on and is very long.   I equally add there are many people I know that feel the same about the Labour party and they too are moving to Reform.\n\nWhen I saw what Reform stood for and the changes it proposed, this was a real awakening to what I had been missing and acted as a realisation of what we have lost focus of in our great country.\n\nLike so many of us, I was an armchair politician and would sit and watch the news with total frustration as I saw free speech being lost and as woke ideology was being forced through by a few whilst the many of us sat and watched how it was damaging so many elements of our society.\n\nThat was the point I thought it’s time to no longer tell the TV what should change, but join and stand for a party that will actually do something about it and have the strength to action change and not simply submissively keep rolling other , and so here I stand with all those that agree with Reform.  I had served as a local councilor and so could see at first hand, that with a little bit of evert, real change could be achieved.\n\nAs previously noted, I travel around the constituency a lot and have visited many of our great pubs and other venues and I have heard an increasing move towards Reform with others like me that agree that Britain is broken and needs change, the polls support this growth and I now feel its time to get together and I hope to be elected by the people of central Devon to implement Reforms policies into practice and serve the constituency.",

Firstly, in sales and marketing and then in business management. I worked for Sperry Univac and McDonnell Douglas Information Systems as a sales manager, Siemens Nixdorf as a divisional director and NeXT computer (a direct report to Steve Jobs) as Managing Director of the UK Northern Europe and EMEA. Following that I was an owner director of a software business which was sold and then a founder of a Business-to-Business sales and marketing agency which is still active. So basically, I am a businessman and not a career politician.\n\nApart from voting NO in Wilson's referendum and Conservative for most of my life my first real involvement in politics was campaigning for the 2016 referendum. In 2019 I joined the Brexit party soon after Nigel formed it and campaigned locally for the European Elections. I then was appointed as the candidate for Macclesfield in the 2019 Election but was stood down by the party and was re-assigned to the Wallasey constituency at the last minute and managed to come 3rd beating the Lib Dems.\n\nAfter the debacle of the Boris/Truss/Sunak nightmare I joined Reform and was appointed as PPC for Congleton.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the time has come to sweep away the current political landscape. Ever since the demise of Margaret Thatcher this country has gone from bad to worse. Neither the Tory or Labour parties have really got to grips with the key issues and it really is time for REFORM.\n\nIf elected I promise to faithfully represent all constituents no matter which party, they support without favor. I strongly believe politics begins at home and the first task of an MP is to be there for their constituency to take up local issues and to work to resolve them. I will set up a local office which will be open for constituents during normal working hours and on one day every weekend. I will hold regular weekly surgeries. I will hold these in different locations as the constituency is geographically large and your MP needs to be accessible to everyone.",

You may think that sounds harsh but to other Forces Brats, it conveys an independence of thought, a determination to get ‘the job done’ and a firm sense of what is right and what is wrong, and as such being an Army Brat is matter of immense pride for me.  My father did his 2 years National Service… and just didn’t get round to leaving for an extra couple of decades.\n\nI moved around a lot, different places, different schools, lots and lots of different people, all however united to serve something other than themselves.  Eventually we moved to Fife in Scotland.  And I was lucky enough to have come into the Scottish Education system when it was the best in the nation.\n\nAgain I was lucky enough to go to Kirkcaldy Tech – ok, I may remember the amazing pub crawls more than my course, but I have fantastic memories of my time in Kirkcaldy.\n\nSince then, I’ve worked in the hospitality industry, the service industry, on the phone in a call centre, as a data analyst, had a family and I find myself to still have the old Army attitude, as when I see something that’s ‘wrong’ or not working, I want to do all I can to ‘fix’ it and make it work again.\n\nIf anyone doesn’t think our country needs ‘fixing’ then I’m happy for you and would like to live where you are.\n\nFor everyone else who sees what is happening to our country and wants ‘someone’ to sort it, then vote for Reform, vote for me, and we will fix it.  But we need you to vote for us, without that we don’t have even a chance of fixing our country.\n\nWhy am I standing as the Reform UK Scotland PPC for Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy\n\nI am the person you passed on the street a while ago.  Busy going about my day just like you were; getting the messages, wondering if I should put the heating on when I get home.  Then I looked up… and saw what was going on around me; millions of pounds spent on housing men who have come to our country illegally, men who accost our women and young girls in the street, making our town centres areas you just don’t want to go in the evening.  Millions of pounds spent on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, jobs given on the basis of sex and ethnicity rather than on ability.  Anyone in the work environment knows at least one person who is a ‘Diversity hire’.  All this going on whilst our Veterans – men and women who have served the greater good, worked and risked their lives for our country and way of life are left homeless on the streets.  British citizens who have paid their taxes all their lives, out on the street with nothing, no help; all while our Government allows more and more illegal migrants into our country and places them in hotels, new housing schemes. I have the words for how this makes me feel, I’m just not allowed to put them here.   Our democracy is being eaten away; our children being indoctrinated rather than educated.  Teachers used to teach children ‘how to think’ not ‘what to think’.  Instead of ‘ticking boxes’ teachers should be free to get back to actual teaching.      \n\nFor all of the above, I realised that I had had enough, and rather than sit and watch our country deteriorate further, I resolved to do something about it, that’s why I’m standing, for the Scottish/British people and for Reform UK.",

I don't recognise it anymore. It's time for strong men and women to come forward with the courage to say enough is enough. \n\nThe dramas and chaos of the past 14 years under the Conservatives have left our nation fractured and exhausted, plagued by deep-seated issues ranging from lower living standards and a housing crisis, to an impossibly stretched healthcare system and sky-high crime rates. Labour's approach of division and identity politics will only further exacerbate social problems, neglecting the everyday struggles of working-class communities in pursuit of woke ideological agendas. Their infeasible plan to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030 will make us poorer, and their reckless spending will bankrupt us.\n\nBoth parties lack a viable solution to the security crisis at our borders and the catastrophe of uncontrolled immigration. Labour Home Secretary, John Reid, deemed the immigration system \"not fit for purpose\" as far back as 2006. Successive Labour and Conservative administrations have failed to address this institutional breakdown. I strongly believe in the adage that where there's a will there's a way. I am equally convinced that Reform UK is the only party with that genuine determination.\n\nWith a track record of standing up for what's right and getting results,  I am the candidate who will fearlessly confront the establishment and work tirelessly to improve the lives of people in the City of Durham, and help make Britain great.\n\nI have been married for 24 years and have lived in the North-East with my wife and son for the last 20 years.

I worked closely with the previous Reform UK spokesman for Darlington and am well aware of the issues facing people in our great town. I was born and raised in Darlington. I spent my childhood living on Clifton Road and then moved to Geneva Drive. I now live in the Hundens Lane area of Darlington with my wife. I am an English teacher who has spent over ten years helping children achieve their potential. I have worked at a school in Bishop Auckland and several other schools in the North of England. I have also been fortunate to have taught in other countries, including the USA, Kazakhstan, and South Korea. I volunteered in orphanages, helping some of the most impoverished children take their first steps to a better life. My work is extremely rewarding, and it would take a lot for me to even think about leaving my job, but I can no longer sit in silence and watch our country be torn apart. I have been an active campaigner in Darlington for many years, knocking on doors and organising community events. The majority of people tell me the same thing; “We must stop illegal immigration. They are laughing at us.”  “Why are we spending money keeping foreign criminals in this country? Why aren’t we deporting them?”  “Why are we giving foreign aid to China and India when people in our country are homeless?” “Why is my tax going up and the level of services going down?” I’ve decided to stand in this election because the country we love needs us. At this election, you finally have a choice. If Labour gets in, our borders will be wide open. The Conservatives have failed us. Only Reform UK has the policies to save our country. Only Reform UK will deliver the change this country needs. But this election isn't about me. It is about you, the voter. Your vote is precious; vote for something you believe in rather than the lesser of two evils. This town and you, the people, have masses of potential. What we need is a politician who believes in the people of this town, who will put Darlington first, and who has not been parachuted in by their party's Head Office. We have a Labour leader who believes a woman can have a penis; if he can lie about that, he will lie about everything, and a Conservative government who have proved time after time that they are incapable of governing. I want to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people in Darlington who feel all politicians are the same. Politicians have stopped listening to the people. I will listen and act upon your concerns. Your views are not wrong. They are held by the majority of people.  You know this because you have daily conversations with your friends and neighbours who agree with you. If you demand a better country with politicians who feel exactly the same way you do, please vote REFORM UK on 4th July, and let's change this country for the better. Remember: Your vote is precious. Labour and Conservatives will try and scare you into thinking a vote for Reform UK is a wasted vote, but it isn’t. If enough people vote Reform UK, then we will win in Darlington.

We need to increase the level of Policing and return to using “Bobbies on the Beat” who actually know the local area and the people in it and importantly the ones causing all the issues.\n\nWe need to help make work pay and one of the ways Reform UK has suggested is to raise the start point of Income Tax to £20 000 per annum.  This gives an automatic pay rise to everybody and the poorest benefit the most. \n\nOur NHS seems to be hopelessly broken. At present we all seem to know or know of someone who is on a waiting list for months or even years for a minor operation.

The people of Clwyd North and all of Wales deserve better. Here’s my plan:\n\nRevitalise Our Economy: We need to embrace a more free-market approach to ensure our local businesses can thrive. I propose scrapping business rates and raising the VAT threshold to make trading easier both domestically and internationally.\n\nSupport Our Farmers: Farmers are the backbone of our country. I will work to scrap the unrealistic Net-Zero targets and the rewilding scheme enforced by the Welsh Labour government, which coerces farmers into surrendering 20% of their land for wildflowers and trees in exchange for subsidies.\n\nChampion Individual Freedom: I stand firmly against the introduction of a Digital ID and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) system, which threaten to turn citizens into state-controlled entities. I will fight to uphold absolute freedom of speech by repealing draconian hate speech laws and banning facial recognition technology. Additionally, I advocate for withdrawing from the WEF, WHO, and UN to restore our sovereignty.\n\nReform the Tax System: Our tax system needs a complete overhaul. I propose raising the income tax threshold to £20,000 per year, which would provide working people with an additional £1,500 annually. Furthermore, I support scrapping VAT on energy bills to ease the financial burden on households.\n\nInvest in Nuclear Energy: We should aggressively pursue nuclear energy to secure cheaper energy bills and long-term energy security.\n\nOverhaul Road Tax: I will push for a return to the road fund licence system, as it existed before 1936. With the Vehicle Excise Duty generating around £35 billion per year and the estimated cost to repair roads being £13.5 billion, we have the funds needed. Road tax should be based on vehicle weight rather than emissions, potentially allowing for future tax reductions.\n\nControl Immigration: It's essential to freeze immigration and stop illegal crossings. Mass immigration has strained our housing, healthcare, schools, and wages. By freezing immigration, we can focus on building adequate housing for current residents.\n\nThe people of Clwyd North deserve a representative who will fight for their interests and work tirelessly to bring about real change. I am that candidate, and I am committed to making Clwyd North and Wales a better place for all.",

I joined the party because I’m passionate about making this country a much better place for everyone living here. As part of the Reform Party, I want to make a positive difference in the community and help create big changes in London. We must stop rising crime and gang violence culture by working on increasing funding for the Met, and enable more searches .We should improve policing on local housing estates.  I want to abolish the ULEZ charge south of the Thames, where there is no strong reason to charge people for driving through the Capital. Roads we all know that they are in a terrible condition and it is costing hardworking people millions of pounds to repair damage to their vehicles. I want to enforce fines to be issued to councils if they continue to be negligent with maintenance.   We should continue to increase funding for the NHS and prevent waiting times. We should ensure that children have adequate meals, Proper nutrition is vital for physical and mental health.  We should ensure help and support for struggling families, increase disability benefits and lower the retirement age. We should encourage small businesses to open with lower business rates and more grant availability. We should manage the transfer of human jobs to AI responsibly. We should do more to protect British farming. We continue to be strongly in favour of stopping the boats . We should do much more to provide proper trauma treatment and mental health support for our Armed Forces through Government funded sources. I would like to ensure all young people and first time buyers have a fair shot at buying a first home with more government supported schemes to reduce these costs and allow borrowing to be more available. I would like to start a scheme that entitles young people to exchange student loans for a deposit on a first home. This could work, if you apply for a mortgage the student loans could be deducted from the interest of the mortgage under this new scheme.",

        "statement_to_voters": "I’m not dissimilar to most of you?\n\nI had no experience of political activism and was just happy to leave it to others, until 2016. I campaigned for Brexit and was betrayed by our politicians. I’ve watched this country stumble from crisis to crisis, our career politicians only concerned with themselves, lacking common sense, lacking answers, seemingly unaccountable and with a total disconnect with the population.\n\nUnderstanding that shouting at the telly wasn’t going to change anything, I decided to stand and serve my local community on behalf of Reform UK.\n\nI was a police officer for 30 years with Northamptonshire Police, in every large town and almost every role. Policing provides experiences and a skill set that equips me to be an effective Member of Parliament. I hold a third Dan black belt in Ju Jitsu and am a qualified personal trainer and used to help run a martial arts club in Northampton.\n\nI’ve lived in Northamptonshire since 1976 and in the constituency for about ten years, with my wife, who is a schoolteacher. We have four children, all of whom were educated in Corby.\n\nAt a time when we have the highest taxation since WW2, why are our Public Services and infrastructure in such a poor state?\n\nI too am frustrated that our Health Service is broken, its mismanaged, and for too long has been used as a political football, with the necessary action required to make it a first-class Health Service, put off, for another day. Why can’t I, and many of you, get an NHS Dentist, or an appointment with my GP when I phone up? Why are our elderly treated as commodities and ignored. Reform and I will change this.\n\nEducation is a proven way out of poverty, so why shouldn’t we all have the best education, improved facilities, and a safe place to learn? Our nation’s poorly performing schools need the best teachers to educate, motivate and encourage our children that they can succeed. I will fight for our children’s futures and a renewed respect for education.\n\nOur Government and Councils continue to mismanage their finances as it’s easy to spend someone else’s money. We elect those who decide how those taxes are spent, its only right that we, the Public, hold them to account how they spend our money. I will hold them to account.\n\nIncreasing Illegal and uncontrolled immigration are having an adverse impact on this country and its infrastructure. An increase of over 10 million people since 2001, resulting in not enough housing, accommodation provided to migrants ahead of vulnerable British people, not able to get a dentist or medical treatment on the NHS, lack of local school places, drain on the Exchequer, increased taxation, and our roads are full of potholes.  Reform is the only party that has said it will stop the boats, we have a plan that involves putting the British People at the centre of everything.\n\nPolicing and Justice is close to my heart. Do you feel safe in your home or going to the shop? Criminals, and the louts, no longer fear being caught, they no longer fear the Police, they no longer fear being punished, they no longer feel community condemnation and they no longer fear Justice. Our Police Leadership need to get a grip on crimes that impact society, they need to be impartial, and our Justice system needs to speed up and get tough on criminals, if we need more jails, build them.\n\nI will be tough on criminals and those in the Justice system who fail to share this vision. Justice should be swift and fair, with the victim at the heart of it. I will push for early guilty admissions to be dealt with by the Courts on the day of charge. Trials will be heard even if the defendant fails to turn up to frustrate Justice, this will ensure that Justice is swift, and the victim and witnesses are considered.\n\nWe also need to invest in our youth, diverting them from a life of crime, and to encourage and support our community in challenging this behaviour. It requires a holistic approach with the involvement of local employers, developers, etc.\n\nI want people to be rewarded for their hard work, financial prudence, and social responsibility. It’s my belief that everyone should contribute to their community to the best of their abilities.\n\nThe challenges facing us are many, and doing the same things, which aren’t working again and again, can only be described as stupid and pointless. It’s time for change, it’s time for Reform.\n\nDo you want a Public Servant that you can trust to make real change?",

I believe taxpaying residents deserves more than the Council is currently delivering.\n\nA particular issue I am very troubled by is the rising level of violent crime, anti-social behaviour and drug dealing in the town which has been exacerbated by the closure of our police station that not only provided a safe, open place to residents needing to use it, its presence, without doubt, provided a deterrent against crime in Eastleigh itself and the wider constituency.  We have the right to feel safe in our town and constituency with a visible police presence to provide that comfort and assurance, not a remote office on the outskirts of town that you cannot walk into without making an appointment.\n\nAbout Me\n\nA bit more about me, I worked for the NHS at Omega House for almost five years, supporting a Clinical Commissioning Group Board which gave me a working insight into how public services are organised and delivered… there is a lot of work to do.  I also worked for the Commissioning Support Unit at Omega House in the Freedom of Information Team dealing with requests from members of the public, Councillors and Members of Parliament for Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions.\n\nFor a time in 2015, I worked at Prysmian in their centenary year, supporting the CEO and Senior Management Team and whilst there was involved in organising a UK Trade and Industry visit.\n\nWhilst working for a large financial services organisation in Southampton, I was Chair of the UK Employee Forum, representing circa 2,000 employees in Southampton and a further 2,500 across the UK. I also lead a local Leaseholder Action Group fighting for much needed changes in Leasehold law via the National Leasehold Campaign to demand the same rights for Leaseholders that other homeowners enjoy.\n\nMy practical career experience, gained in public sector organisations, manufacturing, a social enterprise and professional services, including law and financial services, affords me the knowledge, experience and skills to properly represent you as your Councillor and Member of Parliament..\n\nSo, if you are hungry for meaningful change, are disillusioned with the shenanigans of the main parties or just feel politically homeless, why not consider voting for me and Reform UK…what have you got to lose?",

My children were brought up and educated here.\n\nFollowing service as a policeman I was elected as a councillor in this constituency where I served for 15 years. This election has reactivated me in politics – I have been attracted by the common sense policies of Reform UK. I was formerly a Conservative but our economy has been burdened by the highest taxation in a generation, over regulation, high energy prices and crippling restrictions on personal freedoms. Labour offers more of the same. And the Greens seem to have become anti-science denying the biological reality of male and female (and they are not the only ones to do so!)\n\nThe ‘cancel culture’ of recent years has had a chilling effect; sadly it has often been government and official bodies which have played fast and loose with truth in silencing views other than those they want to impose. I have experienced that in our local council in the attempts to silence whistle-blowers. I want to value and guarantee freedom of expression and individual liberty.\n\nI believe there are many ways to reduce energy costs and so benefit families, the cost of living and the economy. The Government, supported by all other parties, has banned or discouraged the use of energy resources available to us. I have long argued against net zero which is ruinously expensive and lacks justifying evidence. It needs scrapped.\n\nI believe we need lower taxation. Reform UK will raise the tax-free threshold for Income Tax to £20,000 to help the lower paid and motivate those on benefits to move into work. The taxation burden on us ordinary people has never been higher – and especially so in Scotland.\n\nI believe in valuing each person whatever their circumstances. I find that much of the current emphasis on racism and equality actually divides rather than unites us in all our diversity. I want to support families – and whilst not everyone has the opportunity, a stable family provides the best environment for children, and indeed us all.\n\nOh, one more thing. In this uncertain world we have unwisely allowed our Armed Forces to fall to a dangerously low level. I passionately believe the Government’s first duty is to defend its people from foreign and domestic threats.\n\nAnd so, on these and many other issues, I want to offer residents of Edinburgh South the pragmatic, common sense alternative which Reform UK provides. I have experience and local knowledge. Join me. Vote for sensible policies. Vote Reform UK.",

At public expense, and subverting democratic votes, an agenda has been enacted which favours coercion to freedom, corporatism to competition and division to unity.

Flew wartime Dakotas and a variety of jet airliners with 22 years in command, including 12 years checking fellow pilots. My wife and I live on the Downs in this beautiful constituency. Our two surviving children have blessed us with grandchildren and, living nearby, regular grandparent duties! Our son runs his own architectural visualisation business in the constituency.\n\nHaving attended Airbus courses in Toulouse, my first retirement project was in France, supervising the building of a holiday home under the attendant bureaucracy. Keen supporter of Anglo-European cooperation which, in the case of Airbus with its British wings, predates our joining the EEC in 1972, I nevertheless tired of the apparent disdain in which the UK was regarded by European elites. Disappointing, considering our unique contributions to European unity in two world wars and our honesty in EU membership.\n\nSimilarly disenchanted with the Tories under David Cameron, I joined UKIP in 2015 to campaign in the General Election and the 2016 Referendum. Dismayed with parliamentary prevarication on Brexit and the collapse of UKIP, I joined the Brexit Party in 2019 and campaigned in the European Elections. Our overwhelming victory toppled Mrs May’s premiership and in the subsequent General Election we stood down half our candidates, allowing Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority to “get Brexit done”.\n\nNevertheless, Brexit is yet to be completed or exploited by this craven government. It and HM Opposition contain a majority of diehard Remainers. We live in a dis-United Kingdom with Northern Ireland’s domestic and international trade controlled by Brussels, our fisheries open to foreign exploitation, and a European court dictating how we protect our borders and sovereignty. Net immigration, which Tory manifestos have long promised to reduce to the tens of thousands, is two-thirds of a million annually. That tens of thousands arriving from the safety of France - mainly anonymous young males seeking a better life - are assisted to violate the UK border by our own Border Force, while British citizens queue at Passport Control, is a national disgrace. And, at that moment, the injustice and cost to us all is just beginning.\n\nA “Conservative” administration has, during 14 years in office, presided over a steady decline in our country. Law and order have broken down and intolerant minority groups allowed to seize control of our everyday lives. Increasingly authoritarian and egged on by all the opposition parties, this government abandoned pandemic planning, locking the country down three times, closing schools unnecessarily and trying to mandate experimental vaccines under bogus pretences.\n\nWithout public consultation or the possibility of any significant effect on world CO2 emissions, HMG has been imposing a calamitous, \"Net Zero\" energy policy based on intermittent wind and solar, while failing to plan or provide back-up from home-sourced fossil fuels and nuclear. Forcing cash-strapped families to install expensive, unsuitable heat-pump systems, and banning fossil-fuel powered vehicles for personal and business use is illiberal and authoritarian. Energy prices for ordinary people have soared and the economy suffers, while virtually all our manufacturing has been outsourced to hostile, totalitarian China, the world’s greatest polluter. The title of its recently created Department of Energy Security and Net Zero is a risible contradiction in terms.\n\nStill suffering the long-term effects of family isolations and school closures under Lockdown, children many years below the age of consent have been encouraged to pronounce their sexuality and even question their sex. Like the Leader of the Opposition, my Tory MP, when asked, was unable to define a woman. Femininity has been insulted and its fundamental characteristics denied by some men under a government that claims to be conservative but has deferred to the \"woke\" mind virus. Recruitment to our dangerously depleted armed forces has prioritised criteria of diversity, equity and inclusion over aptitude and potential.\n\nNHS bureaucracy, inefficiency and wastage have increased, as have waiting lists. The dominance of foreign-trained staff in our health and care services and their low levels of pay reflect the failure to motivate and train our own school leavers, many of whom accumulate debt pursuing university courses of little or no use in a future career instead of vocational training. Personal taxation, particularly for low-income earners, encourages many to stay at home on benefit. The recent rise in corporation tax discourages investment in medium-size companies, negating the traditional Tory claim to be pro-business.\n\nWe East Surrey residents face all the above problems. Local issues include increased theft and assault. Our green spaces are under threat because of housing shortages caused by the immigration-driven rise in population, which is also overloading schools, transport, hospitals and other infrastructure. Waiting times at A&E are rising, and too many people are catching infections in hospital. As for the Surrey County Council, questions have been raised about the sale of its iconic Kingston HQ to developers for a knockdown price. It has allowed roads to deteriorate to a dangerous state, potentially fatal for cyclists.\n\nThere is much anger and dismay across the UK. But, let’s face it, if the July 4th election produces a Labour or Lib-Lab coalition government, we can expect all the above lunacy on steroids. And, if the Tories manage by some miracle to hang on to office, they will interpret it as a mandate simply to give us more of the same.\n\nDuring this May, as they agonised over when to call a general election they are bound to lose, the Tories started to row back on some policies, and to try and mend the ship. Too late, Mr Sunak! Reform UK is the only party fielding candidates nationwide in the forthcoming general election that stands for common-sense and the legitimate aspirations of ordinary, decent people who no longer recognise their country. That’s why I am greatly privileged to be standing for Reform in my home constituency of East Surrey.\n\nReform UK is a new, underfunded party.

The strain on our education and health services and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis are as undeniable as they are preventable.\n\nFor years, devolved and national governments have done little to improve matters. In fact, they’re a big part of the problem. Their complicity starts with the failure to acknowledge crucial factors which threaten our stability. Politicians can’t protect voters’ interests unless they put voters first. It’s time for Reform. On 4th July vote for Matt Alexander, your fellow constituent and Reform UK candidate.",

Like many in my generation, I moved away for university training and then again for employment. I believe that training should be diverse, including apprenticeships, internships, and scholarships.\n\nDuring my time in Derby, I contributed to Reform's campaign, leading to the election of the first Reform Mayor. It was fantastic to see local people having a voice.\n\nIn recent years, Welsh options at the ballot box have become limited. Inspired by my experience in Derby, I decided to stand as a candidate to offer the people of Dwyfor Meirionnydd a genuine choice at the ballot box. I am committed to addressing the concerns of locals and supporting the Welsh economy.\n\nThe Welsh economy has tremendous potential, from small business owners to farmers and labourers. Unfortunately, this potential has been hindered by overregulation, high taxation on those least well off, and increasingly poor-quality infrastructure.\n\nFor the first time, there is a party that will raise the tax threshold to £20,000, reduce the burden on small independent businesses, and most importantly, control Britain's borders. My goal in this campaign is to give you, the electorate, a real choice at the ballot box.\n\nI sincerely look forward to campaigning and to the results in July. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nDiolch yn fawr.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLucy Murphy",

The seventies faltered with the three-day week and unelected Unions trying to run the country. I am now witnessing the further destruction of the UK and I want to reverse this.\n\nInitially I studied Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, I then decided that the construction industry would be better and spent thirty years in this industry. I worked on jobs which ranged between large government projects to small and medium developments. I was used as trouble shooter on building sites and turned round failing sites.\n\nI have also worked in the Solar Energy Industry, which already is the answer to most of our energy problems. I’m surprised at the lack of uptake in the UK. My Beliefs\n\nI now believe that both Labour and the Conservatives are unable to lead our country in the right direction. There is no real leadership anymore, just a wish to get re-elected The Health Service\n\nI am a supporter of the NHS. I have seen it in action firsthand with friends and various members of my family. I also have members of my family who have worked in the NHS and still do. I have met people who supply the NHS. They tell me that there is a lot of waste and inefficiency, which I do not blame the staff for as they are wonderful. The staff see problems themselves and tell me about them, but the system doesn’t seem to be able to react or make any changes. I suggest we correct the problems we have at the moment before simply spending more taxpayer’s money. Our Armed Services\n\nAt present we can get the whole of the British army into Wembley Stadium, this is not sustainable! Even the role of the Royal Navy is diminishing due to lack of recruits, leaving our role in the world to be at a dangerous level. This needs to reversed. Infrastructure\n\nLong ago the days of driving on well kept roads is a thing of the past, we are now paying more for even less in return. Due to government grants being reduced to councils, they are now going bankrupt due to poor management due to unnecessary woke agendas which add no value to what the public really need.\n\nI Would Like: a level playing field for all.

Currently, I reside in Bromley with my wife, a SENCO teacher in Dulwich, and our two sons.\n\nI have strong links to Dulwich and West Norwood (DAWN), having lived in various locations across the constituency since the early 90s. My first job in the UK was pulling pints at the Crown & Greyhound in Dulwich Village and I have been actively involved with a local Rugby Club in Dulwich for 9 years (I am an IRB qualified Rugby coach).\n\nI have had a long career in IT and Finance, first starting in Investment Banking in the early 90’s in London. I am currently a Director with an Investment Bank, working on high-profile projects as a Program Manager. This is a role which I enjoy immensely and is indeed a dream come true for me to be living and working in IT and finance in London.\n\nAfter years of following politics, I became actively involved in 2017 and in 2018 I was elected as a local Councillor in Bromley. During my tenure, I worked diligently at both the ward and council levels, addressing issues such as housing, planning, traffic, and community projects. One notable achievement was leading an initiative to implement secure online council meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring democratic processes continued unabated.\n\nDulwich and West Norwood\n\nWhilst there are a number of international events that have gained much needed attention and scrutiny, as your MP, my primary focus will be the people of DAWN.\n\nDrawing on my experience as a local Councillor, I will work tirelessly to address local issues and support community organisations, particularly those relying on volunteers. My experience in sports club management will be instrumental in engaging with and supporting local clubs and organisations. These clubs and organisations are an under acknowledged key part of our community and must be supported and encouraged.\n\nI stand firmly against Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) and the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), which have proven to be detrimental to social cohesion and disproportionately affect the poorest in our communities. These measures must be removed, and I fully support Reform's policy to legislate their removal across DAWN and the UK.\n\nGeneral Election 2024\n\nRishi Sunak has called a short-dated snap election for 4 July 2024 on 22 May 2024. I find this to be an arrogant and manipulative attempt to subvert democracy. Sunak knows that Reform, along with all parties, including his own, will have to work hard to field candidates, get forms completed and organise campaigns in time. This will mean that the people of DAWN and the UK may not get the opportunity to vote in a fully informed manner. Reform is committed to fielding the full list of candidates and we will be putting in our best efforts in to ensure you the British people have a democratic choice and voice on 4 July 2024.\n\nOn the 4th of July, it is time for the UK to have its own Independence Day, for the British people to be finally rid of the UniParty of Labour and the Tories – we shall not go quietly into the night!",

This country is in trouble.   I thought, as did others I spoke to, that all hope was lost until I discovered Reform UK. As I read their CONTRACT with the people (not a manifesto) I discovered that it could not have been more aligned with my own thoughts, I was excited to discover for the first time there was a political party that spoke to me.  I had to get involved, I had to offer my help, I had to share my enthusiasm for what they stand for, REAL BRITISH VALUES and COMMON SENSE (Because it is no longer common anymore.)   For the first time in my life, I joined a political party.    But I have to do more.   That is why I have decided to stand as a Candidate in the Edinburgh Southwest Constituency for Reform UK Scotland.    We need to ditch the globalist corporate driven agendas forced upon us by other captured political parties who serve up a disruptive Woke, Net Zero, Open Borders dystopia that will collapse our society and bankrupt our nation.   We need to REFORM our country together.",

Yet, after the Conservative Party wasted 14 years of good governance to scandal, ruin, and national decline, Maxwell decided to run for Parliament to offer the constituents of Faversham and Mid Kent a real and trustworthy conservative voice that believes in Britain.\n\nSome people might recognise Maxwell from our television screens and radio. As an avid and ardent campaigner, Maxwell is a political commentator for broadcasters, regularly appearing on TalkTV’s Sunday Morning’s ‘Future Politics Panel’; acting as Reform UK’s only youth representative on the platform. In addition to this, Maxwell has formerly appeared on GB News, twice, to discuss his adverse reaction from the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nDeveloping Perimyocarditis at just 21 years old, the condition changed his life forever. Yet despite this, in 2022, Maxwell petitioned for the Government to change the law surrounding the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. Even now, Maxwell works closely with leading UK organisations for victims of vaccine damage, whilst lobbying MP’s for the much needed change required. Maxwell discussed his condition in an interview with ITV Meridian and calls for an inquiry into Vaccine Production.\n\nIn this election, Maxwell is seeking to provide the constituents of Faversham and Mid Kent a fresh alternative, which will deliver real change. Having seen the country he so desperately loves crumble under the chaos of the Conservative Government, Maxwell has put himself forward to be a unity candidate; an option for voters who feel betrayed and let down by the Conservative’s mismanagement of Brexit, whilst also compassionate about local people and crippling public services.\n\nA vote for Maxwell is a rejection to the two-party political status quo that have opened our borders, torn apart our Union, and worsened and weakened the lives of all working people. As a Reform UK MP, Maxwell will champion Faversham and Mid Kent unreservedly and restore this constituency to its former heights of prosperity.",

It has also led to the increase in the cost of everything in shops as everything has to be delivered and so the tax affects everyone regardless of whether they drive or not.  Lowering fuel duty will help everybody. \n\nReform believe that front loading the Child Benefits system to allow new mothers to stay at home and to enjoy those crucial first years with their new born makes great sense, allowing mums to get on with the important job of being a mum. \n\nPlease take a look at our Contract with the People and then vote for the change that this country needs.

My journey has been one of dedication, resilience, and unwavering commitment to serving our community and country.   A Proud Military Background   My story began in Punjab, India, and in 2003, I moved to the UK in search of greater opportunities and to contribute to a nation I admired. In 2007, I joined the British Army, serving valiantly in the Royal Army Dental Corps. Over nearly eight years of service, I learned the core values of discipline, integrity, and selfless commitment. Even after my active service, I continued to contribute as a reservist while successfully running my own business.   Fighting for Our Rights: Protests and Activism   I have always believed in standing up for what is right. In August 2022, as the cost of living crisis hit hard, I launched a hunger strike at Reading Station. For seven days, I protested to highlight the struggles faced by countless families grappling with soaring living costs, food poverty, and rising homelessness. This act of solidarity drew national attention, but unfortunately, it was met with silence from the Conservative government.   Not one to be deterred, I continued my activism. When the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, pushed through the ULEZ expansion despite widespread opposition, I knew I had to act. In August 2023, I led a week-long hunger strike at Uxbridge Station to protest this punitive policy. This protest garnered international coverage and support from numerous like-minded activists. Together, we demonstrated that we will not stand idle while unfair policies burden our working class.   Why I Joined Politics   Through these experiences, it became clear to me that our current political leaders have lost touch with the real struggles of everyday people. The traditional parties have failed us—The Conservatives have led us towards financial ruin, and Labour's policies threaten to bankrupt our nation further. The systemic issues within our political system require a new approach, one grounded in reality and committed to genuine reform.   I joined Reform UK because I believe in their mission to restore fairness, accountability, and common sense to our government. We need policies that support our working class, ensure financial stability, and uphold our national values. Reform UK stands for cutting government waste, lowering taxes, and making work pay. We have a comprehensive plan to fix the NHS, increase police numbers, and restore public safety.   A Vision for Feltham and Heston   As your MP, I will bring the same dedication and resolve to Parliament that I have shown throughout my career. I will fight for affordable housing, fair wages, and a robust healthcare system. I will ensure that our police are adequately funded and equipped to keep our streets safe. And most importantly, I will listen to you, the people of Feltham and Heston, and make sure your voices are heard.   Join Me in This Fight for Our Future   This election is about more than just choosing a candidate; it's about choosing the direction of our community and our country. On July 4th, vote for a candidate who has proven his commitment to fighting for you. Vote for Prabhdeep Singh and Reform UK.",

To realize this vision, he is running as a candidate for both the London Assembly and the Eltham & Chislehurst parliamentary seat on behalf of Reform UK.\n\nDiverging from the typical career politician, Mark's journey began with securing a management role at a major UK retailer after graduation. Subsequently, he spent seven years in East Asia, establishing a successful trading business. This experience offered him a firsthand perspective on the vast opportunities that an independent Britain could seize, leading him to identify withdrawal from the EU as essential. Mark's steadfast belief in Brexit continues to shape many of his political convictions.\n\nUpon his return, Mark chose to settle in The Royal Borough of Greenwich in London. Disturbed by the national failures of The Conservative Party and the local shortcomings of the Labour Party, he felt compelled to do more than just complain from the sidelines. This commitment led him to contest elections for Reform UK in the 2021 London Assembly Elections and the 2022 local council elections in Greenwich. Despite not winning, Mark maintained an optimistic outlook, stating, 'I may not have won, but we are building an entirely new party that will succeed in time. Yesterday, more than 4,000 people came out to vote for me, and I'll take that as a start!'\n\nMark's political beliefs, shaped by his real-world experience and countless conversations with voters on the doorstep, centre around the vision of a strong, respected &independent United Kingdom. He emphasizes prioritizing 'traditional' values that resonate with the majority over trendy, metropolitan ones.\n\nAt the national level, Mark advocates for lifting the poorest out of paying tax by raising the income tax threshold to £20,000, providing an extra £30 per week to the poorest in society. He also calls for Net Zero immigration, arguing that adding a city close to the size of Birmingham to the population each year is unsustainable. Drawing from his observations on the streets of London, Mark believes that part of the solution to divided communities and a lack of assimilation lies in a one-in, one-out approach.\n\nIn his campaign, Mark Simpson invites you to join him in shaping a future where Reform UK's values guide the nation toward prosperity and a renewed sense of pride in its identity. \n\nIt's time for Reform UK; it's time to save Britain.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Hello. My name is Stephen Bird and I am representing the Reform UK Party for Enfield North. Reform UK has a strong focus on fielding local candidates who know, understand and are committed to their local area; I am no exception. I was born, grew up and went to school in Enfield. I have always thought Enfield is a fantastic place to live, and we need the right policies to enable it to thrive.  \n\nMy motivation for seeking to be your MP is to fight North Enfield's corner at a time when everything seems to be disintegrating at speed. The main parties have run out of ideas and lack the resolve to get the UK and Enfield North back on track. The Conservatives have shown they are unable to run the country, and Labour have shown they are unable to run our council. We find ourselves at a critical juncture when new visionary action is called for rather than continual decline management.\n\nReform UK has a range of national policies to appeal to all walks of life:\n\nWe believe raising the tax-free income limit from £12,570 to £20,000 is long overdue to help hardworking residents with the cost-of-living squeeze;\n\nWe believe we need to nurture the next generation by teaching them how to think rather than what to think, and ensure parents are always fully informed of what their children are learning;\n\nWe believe we need to do more to protect small businesses against retail crime and to create a flourishing local SME ecosystem to provide worthwhile opportunities for the current and next generations;\n\nWe believe we need to scrap interest on student loans and to encourage our young people to gain the technical skills and scholarly knowhow to put our country at the forefront of national and global progress;\n\nWe believe in free speech, and we need to protect civil liberties and freedom of expression.\n\nThese are just a sample of the ideas and aspirations that I, with Reform UK, will deliver for Enfield North and the UK. Please do take a moment to familiarise yourself with the Party and our policies, and lookout for our campaign teams around the constituency.\n\nReform UK has a range of local policies for everyone in Enfield, including:\n\n Housing: Reform UK has a policy of no new building on our Green Belt in Enfield, so Reform UK would stop this from Day 1. There are many brownfield sites available, and as TFL is one of the biggest landowners in London, a Reform UK administration would use this TFL land which would include tripling the affordable housing builds.\n\nPolicing: Reform UK will increase visible policing levels. We will instal police public access points in busy retail areas, to reduce anti-social behaviour and retail crime, and make our streets safer. We will reduce police paperwork, which will allow more bobbies on the beat.\n\nTransport: Reform UK will make sure we have an integrated bus, tube and train system. We will make sure all tube and train stations are on a bus route and align with bus timetables. We will Get London Moving!\n\nJobs: Reform UK will create a favourable environment for small and medium size businesses to set up and thrive in Enfield, to create jobs for the residents of Enfield.\n\nI am determined that together we can create the right environment for Enfield North to be the best it can be.

It instilled in me a sense of service and a determination to defend freedom and democracy.  From there I went to work with Lincolnshire Police.  Firstly as a call taker taking tens of thousands of calls giving me a very good understanding of the concerns of residents.  I went on to be a Major Incident Resource Manager and Crime Intelligence Analyst. I was a Lincolnshire County Councillor for 17 years including being chairman of the overview and scrutiny committee.  During four years on West Lindsey District Council I was appointed Deputy Leader of the council.  During this time I was an NHS governor and served on the then Police Committee giving me particular insights in both areas.  Over the last four years I was on Gainsborough Town Council and covered for a time as town Clerk before being elected Mayor of Gainsborough last year.  My ethos has always been one of service to the people, whether as a soldier, with the Police or as a Councillor. Our country is worse off both financially and culturally.  The economy isn’t growing.  It is being wrecked by record taxes, wasteful government spending and record mass immigration which is damaging our country.  Brexit has been betrayed.  Multiculturalism has imported separate communities that reject our way of life.  ‘Woke’ ideology has captured our public institutions.  Only Reform UK will stand up for British culture, identity and values.",

Today, I reside here with my partner, Claire, and our two loyal dogs, as we embark on the journey of renovating our first home.\n\nOver the years, my involvement in local politics has been driven by profound frustration with the major parties. Their persistent inability—or unwillingness—to address the critical issues confronting our nation and our communities is a betrayal of public trust. It is not just the grand national challenges that are neglected but also the pressing local issues in our towns and rural areas. These problems demand nothing more than courage and common sense to resolve.\n\nImagine the potential of our high streets revitalized with strategic investment, invigorating our local economy. Envision our farmers receiving the support they deserve, recognized for their vital contributions, equal to those of our nurses and teachers. These are not lofty dreams but attainable goals, requiring a steadfast commitment to our values and our people.\n\nI seek to be the Member of Parliament for Frome and East Somerset to be a true advocate for the residents of our often-overlooked rural communities. This campaign is about more than just politics; it’s about standing up for those who have been left behind, speaking truth to power, and having the courage to make necessary changes.\n\nFrome boasts a vibrant high street and a strong local identity that we should celebrate, setting an example for others to follow. We have a core community in Midsomer Norton and Radstock, an area with a rich mining and industrial heritage in need of significant investment to rejuvenate and reach its full potential. Between these urban hubs lies a vast rural expanse, making up the best county in the nation. However, its villages and hamlets are often overlooked in Westminster. As the MP for Frome and East Somerset, I intend to change that, ensuring the next government is kept up at night by our relentless push for growth and rural investment in Somerset.\n\nFurthermore, we must tackle rural crime and county lines drug trafficking, which disproportionately affect our younger demographics. This must stop, now.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for a strong, unwavering voice. A voice that will not shy away from ruffling feathers, a voice determined to act decisively and push for the changes essential to steer our country back onto the right path. Together, we can build a future that honours the promise of our past and fulfils the potential of our present.",

As the CEO of UV Group Plc, he understands the importance of effective leadership and practical solutions. Married with two kids and two dogs, Darren's personal life grounds him in the everyday realities of the people he aims to represent.\n\nDarren's journey into politics was catalyzed by the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum, where he witnessed the disregard for the democratic process firsthand.

Darren advocates for a smaller state where individuals have more control over their lives. He is staunchly opposed to the Net Zero agenda, viewing it as economically damaging and environmentally ineffective. Darren is committed to reducing taxes, fostering economic growth, and implementing sensible immigration policies. Furthermore, he aims to overhaul public services, including the NHS, to ensure they are efficient and accessible to all.\n\nFor Darren, politics is not about personal gain; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of ordinary people.

I work within the NHS and am also a Reform UK Ward Councillor on North east Lincolnshire Council. \n\nAt a local level I work hard representing residents and helping wherever possible with their local issues. North east Lincolnshire Council had previously been a Labour stronghold, but since 2019 has been run by the Conservatives. Both Parties have failed to advance the area and the Council continues to come under intense scrutiny locally due to some of the decisions made and obsession with vanity projects.\n\nI have been politically active since the age of fifteen, being elected as the youngest Councillor in the country aged eighteen. I recently resigned the Conservative Party whip and joined the Reform Party, because I truly believe Reform’s policies will take our country forwards.\n\nLike many people, I became disillusioned with the last decade of Government, I have also witnessed Labours shift to the extreme left under Jeremy Corbyn, supported in full by Kier Starmer. I cannot support a man who cannot definitively state what a woman is. \n\nI realised that I had become politically homeless, with neither of the main political parties offering common sense policies, credibility or demonstrating any care for communities or our Country.\n\nI cannot understand how the minority have been allowed to force this woke culture upon us, taking over our institutions and eroding our freedoms. Freedom of speech is, in my view an essential element of our democracy, but we are constantly questioned over the use of 'inappropriate pronouns'. I worry where this may end up. The Conservatives have allowed it during their time in Government, and I fear a Labour Party would only make it worse. What is a woman, Keir? \n\nOur border control is failing. Both legal and illegal migration is wholly mismanaged and has resulted in over ten million immigrants welcomed in the last twenty years. This is with minimal improvements to roads, rail, schooling, NHS or defence. Our Justice system is close to collapse, prisons overflowing, net zero being forced upon us whilst developing countries pump out CO2 in huge quantities. \n\nI approached Reform UK after studying their policies and watching their rapid growth over the last few years. The party shares pretty much every view that I hold. \n\nPeople do say to me that a vote for Reform UK is a vote for Labour. In my opinion, the Conservatives are already set for many years in opposition regardless. And deservedly so for what they have done to our people and country. But in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, as UKIP have shown before with impressive polling, we could just steal this election from under Labour’s nose. Whether Labour or the Conservatives were to get in, you would be getting two sides of the same coin, so a vote for Reform is not a wasted vote.  \n\nMany people also ask me what I could hope to achieve if elected with Reform UK in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. Simply, I can be the most straight-talking voice that our area has ever had in Westminster. Unwhipped, holding any Government to account relating to local and national issues, I enjoy questioning decisions and making alternative solutions. I am a young man who is hungry for change.\n\nVote Labour or Tory, expect more of the same. But you can’t complain.",

Schools are teaching woke nonsense, and increased crime on our streets is making town centres no-go places for women. Police are inundated with ridiculous requests to investigate ‘hurt feelings’.\n\nOur green countryside is being concreted over, and the number of houses built will never keep up with the numbers. GP appointments are difficult to obtain, and there is an annual fight for school places. \n\nMeanwhile, villages in the constituency are suffering with quarry traffic thundering past their doors and the threat of pylons obliterating the landscape. \n\nEnough is enough! We need to STOP THE BOATS and set net zero migration. This is achievable under existing legislation. The civil service needs instructions, not an invitation to run the country. \n\nOur NHS needs reforming from the top down. We need to strip away meaningless jobs and ‘diversity’ targets and get back to caring for our sick. Our cancer success rate is low because people aren't being diagnosed early enough. I'd like to see a German-style NHS with higher wage earners supporting it through private health care. Germans screen more widely and their healthcare is preventative rather than reactive. We could look at remuneration as part of the overhaul. \n\nHarwich requires urgent regeneration with a modern road system to match. The A120 is frequently beset with traffic collisions and diversions; it needs dualling. We have been promised action at the underpass in Manningtree, but there has been no delivery.\n\nWith every field lost to housing, our food security is weakened, increasing imports and prices.

My first thirty years were spent in Manchester, three years in Cambridgeshire, ten years in Bradford, and now a decade in Oxfordshire. My early working years were spent as a statistical analyst for an insurance company before pursuing a vocation in youth and children's work in the voluntary sector. Currently, I work for Sainsbury's while establishing my own transport business.\n\nI'm a Northerner by temperament, a Christian by conviction, and an activist by nature. This is why I can't simply stand by and watch the establishment decimate our great nation and squander our heritage. Reform offers the best opportunity to stop the rot.\n\nHere's a postcard summary of my politics: I'm a freedom fighter, proud patriot, free market fundamentalist, social conservative, Christian chauvinist, political populist, climate realist, cultural traditionalist, and eternal optimist. In essence, I'm what used to be called a conservative.\n\nI have campaigned for Brexit, resisted the Covid tyranny, and championed free speech. Diversity is not a strength— unity is. A common culture creates social cohesion; multiculturalism erodes it. The real climate crisis is the climate of hysteria. Strong families are the bedrock of a society: marriage is sacred, children are a blessing. A secure future depends on promoting motherhood, not mass immigration. The state should work for you, and far fewer people should work for the state.\n\nBut don't let me —or anyone else— hoodwink you with soundbites. Our nation's accelerating decline needs far more than political intervention. We need divine intervention. I believe our nation needs prayer as well as policy, and to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the source and foundation of our culture & civilisation.\n\nDon't let the Conservatives con you any longer, or blackmail you with threats of Starmer, or beg you to forgive their infidelity with promises of \"this time I really will be faithful\". The odds might be against us, but if Reform can win anywhere, we can win in Henley & Thame. I'd appreciate your vote. And if you can spare any time or money to help campaign, that would be very welcome too.",

He is married and has two grownup children. Sailing, fly-fishing and birdwatching occupy his spare time, outside of election periods.\n\nJonathan has been involved in almost every British election since 1979, commencing as a candidate for the Referendum Party Ltd, in 1997, in Edgbaston, because he believed that we were entitled to have a vote before joining the Euro. It became clear to him that the standard political parties were trying to undermine British people’s own sovereignty without their knowledge or consent. Jonathan stood in the West Bromwich West by-election for the fledgling UKIP party as “ground zero”, in doing so creating a mark in the sand for UKIP as a political party, fighting in every election. There followed three European Parliament elections, local elections, and in 2009 and 2015, he stood in the North Herefordshire seat for parliament in the UK, taking second place.\n\nSo now Jonathan is “back in the fray” for Reform UK, aiming to make the lives of Halesowen people more fruitful, in a greener environment with greater protection for Green spaces, with more money in their pockets , VAT down to 18%, no income tax for the first £20,000 of earnings, and easy access to the NHS, living in a country where we do not fear to walk, and aiming to play a part in a government that actually serves the British people, rather than simply draining the life out of taxpayers.\n\nJonathan wants to regain freedom of choice over cars and car travel, by destroying ULEZ schemes, opposes National Service for school leavers, supports legal migration with visas, and believes that we can and should end all illegal migration on day one of the next government. He is fed up with British voters being taken for fools by successive governments, and “uniparty politics”, where only the leader changes and the policies all remain the same.  Enough of that!

My background includes service in the Parachute Regiment and 22 SAS, military advisory roles, and being a best-selling author. My diverse experiences, including surviving bombings, shootings, and even napalm, shape my unique perspective and determination.\n\nI’m running for Reform UK to honour an oath I took over 40 years ago. The desecration of war monuments by Hamas sympathizers and the subsequent weak responses from the Tory/Labour UniParty pushed me to stand up. Reform UK condemned these acts, unlike the other parties who only reluctantly rebuked them.\n\nLocally, I’m committed to addressing vital issues such as improving the NHS, social care, supporting local businesses, and tackling the pothole crisis, especially on roads like Yazor Road and the road to Madley. However, I also warn of the broader dangers we face, including perpetual wars driven by financial motives, and the risk of conscription in conflicts like the one in Ukraine.\n\nOur Armed Forces are treated poorly, prosecuted unjustly, a trend that began under Tony Blair and continues today. Reform UK is the only party with the resolve to confront these injustices. I am appalled by our government's failures, from the Grenfell disaster to the Horizon Post Office scandal, and the recent Sepsis scandal.\n\nI reject ideologies like ESG, DEI, CRT, and extreme gender theories, which many voters have raised concerns about. Additionally, I believe that current climate policies and Net Zero initiatives often place undue financial burdens on working and middle-class families. Reform UK advocates for practical, balanced approaches to these issues, focusing on common sense and individual freedom.\n\nMass immigration is eroding our national cohesion, and our security services are strained by the threat of radical extremists. The disastrous lockdowns have devastated our economy, education, and mental health, yet mainstream parties may attempt such overreach again. Reform UK champions strong, experienced leadership to navigate these challenges.\n\nI will tirelessly advocate for Herefordshire, unlike the UniParty, which has burdened us with high taxes, a broken NHS, and a housing crisis. I know what a woman is, and I distrust the UniParty’s promises about pensions. Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin, both detrimental to our nation.\n\nReform UK is committed to protecting our farmers and ensuring food security.

I live with my wife in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire.\n\nI trained as a Chemist (London University) and now run a small business selling Pharmaceutical testing equipment.\n\nMy mother was English and had survived the War, unlike a large proportion of her family.  She was a dress designer and worked in a studio for Susan Small.  My uncles (her brothers) were both instrument makers; one made artificial horizons for the RAF and the other sextants for the Royal Navy; both died in the Blitz.\n\nMy father was Polish and was in a Siberian Gulag until 1941 when he was allowed to “walk” from there to Jerusalem.  He joined up, under age as he had been in Officer’s Cadet School in Poland.  He saw service, first in the army (Carpathian Lancers) and then (by virtue of his contacts) in the RAF.  His maths was fairly sharp and so he was a navigator in 301 Bomber Squadron.  The Polish divisions of the RAF (of which there were 14) called England the “island of last hope”.  Many Polish airmen were allowed to stay in England after the war (in no small part thanks to their English colleagues) as the fate of many soldiers returning to Poland was to be shot by the Russians.  This was the fate of both my great Grandfather and his brother who were shot by Bolsheviks in 1919 and 1917.\n\nMy father’s family were very privileged in pre-war Poland but with this came a sense of duty and responsibility which meant looking after those who worked for them.  This sense of duty and honourable behaviour was engrained into me from an early age. \n\nI am involved in local politics and have served as Mayor of our town of Sawbridgeworth.   In this time, my chosen charity was the RAF ATC Squadron: No.: 309.  I chose them, not only because the Squadron was a Polish war time fighter reconnaissance unit, but also because of the life training given to young people by a very inspirational leadership.\n\nUntil recently I was a trustee of a local Day Centre and spent as much time as I could in looking after the running of the centre by raising funds and looking for sponsorship.  The centre was critical for a lot of our elderly citizens who had no other conduit to meet other people or even have hot meals during the week.\n\nI have also been invited of late to join a Guild in the City of London.  This was a real privilege and an honour.  However grand this may seem, the main work of the Guild is to preserve certain heritage aspects in the City of London and to maintain a poor fund to help those in need.  It also sponsors training for young people to become rounded citizens and learn a skill.  Helping with soup kitchens and providing sustenance for those in need is also a fulfilling duty.\n\nBoth my wife and I also support the Battle of Britain Memorial Fund in Capel-le-Ferne and make annual contributions to support this very important Charity as it is important to remember those who gave their lives so that we can live in freedom.  I lay a wreath every year in July on behalf of the PAFF (Polish Airforce Family and Friends Charity) of which I am also a trustee.\n\nDuty and Honour are two very key words in my life.",

This is worsening by the day and any promises made to change by the government are useless and untrue.\n\nAs a teacher with over 25 years’ experience in both secondary and adult education, I had long ago become disillusioned with the left-wing biased indoctrination of emerging educational trainees and professionals, as I watched in horror the disappearance of common sense and core British values in the classroom.\n\nAs I witnessed the demise of core British values, as they slowly faded from the curriculum in order to meet the ever-changing equality and diversity laws, (which dictate schools’ policies under the guise of “multi-culturalism”) I became more worried about the blatant sexualisation of vulnerable young minds by the implementation of “gender recognition” teaching, exposing young, vulnerable minds to sexual content that they are not emotionally developed to understand, or indeed, need to.\n\nI am also a WASPI woman, (Women Against State Pension Inequality) and as such, along with thousands of others, have been treated unfairly by an ill-thought-out government decision on pension equality in the 90s, which has had a detrimental effect on women born in the 1950s, affecting their family lives and health. Successive governments have tried to ignore this injustice and have swept the matter under the carpet. I am passionate about fighting for our rights and will use my political platform to do so.\n\nIn addition to this, the political climate has become so “woke” that it is virtually impossible to have free speech or declare that you are a man or a woman, without fear of retribution and even imprisonment. Fighting this, too, will be a priority of mine.\n\nIt is therefore, due to the continuing anti-democratic government, (run by globalists like the WHO and WEF), that I have decided to join the only party which WILL make the change needed to make Britain great again.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, I will be campaigning robustly with an enthusiastic and loyal team of fellow Reform UK spokespeople and supporters in Leicestershire. I will also be attending as many fellow candidates’ campaigns as possible and supporting the party as a whole; a party which is growing in numbers and momentum daily.\n\nI am truly passionate and dedicated to making change happen so that we regain control of our borders, sovereignty and customs; not to mention our identity (I am STILL a WOMAN and a MOTHER – Not a “person who bears children”) .\n\nSO, LET’S MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN & VOTE REFORM UK!",

Evidence points to the incompetence of our politicians, anxiety about knife crime and the criminal justice system, increasing dysfunction everywhere we look, living beyond our means as a nation, rapidly rising population putting our public services under terrible pressure, our food security Borders and Green Belt under extreme pressures, the decline in quality of the civil service - to name just a few.\n\nMy overarching feeling is that our politicians and most institutions of the state no longer represent us, are no longer fit for purpose, are no longer good for us, indeed are betraying us by causing our decline.\n\nMany serious reforms are urgently required at every institutional level. QUESTION: Which institutions? ANSWER: – all of them: the Head of State and the Royal family, the House of Lords, House of Commons, Departments of State, Government agencies, devolved government, local government at all levels, decision making processes. It will take 6 years to enact reforms, but this is now absolutely urgent and vital for the better functioning of our State.",

My mother was born in West Harrow and my father in South Harrow, they were married on the hill, a long time ago.\n\nI am frustrated with politics and the lack of straight talking and endless electioneering.\n\nPrevious governments have been writing cheques this economy can no longer afford to cash, addressing these macro problems is considered political suicide, but it is what needs to happen. We have high taxes and high debt, an ageing population and a falling birth rate. Mr and Mrs PAYE have been regularly and stealthily plundered for taxes to pay benefits and pensions and this balance needs to be re-addressed.\n\nMy stance is all about the economy and increasing the median take home pay. Our Taxation and Benefits systems are overly complicated and create road-blocks to personal progression. National Insurance is a perverse tax that is easily avoided by the rich, it should be rolled up into the Income Tax rates.\n\nChild Benefit is perverse, it was introduced to take money from the earning man and give it directly to the mother. Is that relevant today? I would rather reward married parents with children via a tax allowance.\n\nWe should decrease the amount of days you are allowed to spend in this country, if you move abroad for tax purposes from 90 days to 5. We are too soft on these people.\n\nWe should raise sales taxes on any company that uses an ultimate holding company based in a tax haven. If they want access to our market, they must pay tax in ours or another sensible economy. That is a country that we trade fairly with and has a sensible rate of corporation tax.\n\nAny immigrant that commits a malicious crime should be deported, regardless of their family status. Asking for asylum should be done online in advance, before entry.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights does write some great law but is also guilty of mission creep and delays of many years. We should leave the ECHR, adopt the good laws and monitor its decisions in the future. Take back control of our borders, reduce immigration both legal and illegal, as our infrastructure cannot cope.\n\nPersonal Independence payments should only be made to people with visible and untreatable disabilities. Anxiety and headaches are too easy to use as a way of obtaining an award. We cannot afford these generous benefits anymore, and need to make a work differential to encourage everyone, who can, to work.\n\nThese are the really important issues but are considered boring. Partygate and an antisemitic Labour party are important but nowhere near as important as the economy, but that is what the media concentrate upon.\n\nOnly Reform UK is prepared to tackle these problems, the other parties are too worried about your vote.

I am Matt Mulliss and I am honoured to be your PPC for the Beautiful Gosport area.\n\nI joined the Reform UK party as their policies and drive for change very much resonate with my own values and views wanting to be part of a country to be proud of again.\n\nI remember as a child people were proud and happy to be British and part of the UK and our great Commonwealth with flags flying in the streets for Queens Jubilees,  anniversaries and the such. Watching on the TV at the commonwealth games and the pride that every single team and onlooker took in the knowledge that they were part of something so much bigger, such a proud and glorious nation and beyond …the envy of the world!!!\n\nI grew up in Hampshire and played on the Solent all my life. I come from a hardworking and honest family with an amazing hard-working mother and father.\n\nI started work life at 16 and got on a YTS (youth training scheme) apprenticeship earning £34.50 a week and worked hard. I am now a marine engineer as well as  marine captain and have been lucky enough to have travelled far and wide around the world and back working on all sorts of marine / sailing projects in different countries dealing with a wide range of different people and cultures.\n\nI also was a senior crewman for volunteer marine search and rescue operations, my last post being the British Virgin Islands ( VISAR ) where I lived for a  few years before being displaced by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. These storms took my business and home and after endeavouring to rebuild for months finally made the decision to return to our beautiful home here in Hampshire. Hurricanes are nothing short of a nuisance and a costly inconvenience luckily none to be found here in Gosport!\n\nI still work as a marine engineer / skipper in the Solent area and around Gosport. The water has been my life. I am also a marine conservationist and marine life enthusiast who has and will continue to fight for the good of our oceans, our treasured Gosport coast lines and beaches.\n\nOver the years it seems I’ve always been fighting for one cause or another from being in 14 major hurricanes, several earthquakes and various other testing and trying events. While being overseas 10 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer which I fought and won only to have it return 6 years ago due to a botched operation in a faraway country.  I beat it again, the consultants say I’m all clear and the type of cancer I had should not return thanks to the help of our much loved and essential NHS who work tirelessly and go above and beyond to look after us sometimes performing nothing less than miracles on a daily basis.\n\nI have fought some tremendous battles and won time and time again. Losing and giving up is not part of my make up and that being said this is also my promise to my Gosport constituents.\n\nI will fight for you with everything I have, I will fight with the strength and valour life has shown me and together we will make our communities thrive and prosper. I will take your fight and make it mine and with your vote together we can make a difference. We can make ourselves proud again. We can make Gosport and Britain great once more. I’m looking forward to meeting and representing you all.",

As part of his degree, he spent 16 months studying politics in Paris, which opened his eyes to the realities of the “European project”. Today, Graham remains a passionate, bilingual European (culturally-speaking) and a strident supporter of the new outward-looking opportunities which Brexit presents.\n\nSince the late 1990's Graham has been self-employed; working as business consultant for some of the UK’s principal telecommunications and managed services companies. He also setup a small manufacturing business, building wine cellars over a 15-year period, whilst employing a small team of ex-offenders in his workshop in Farnham.\n\nFrom working-class roots, he holds political views which are right-of-centre, moderate and coherent. A believer in small state, low taxation economies which operate 'within their means', Graham maintains that SMEs are the beating-heart of Britain’s economy, providing 16m jobs and accounting for half of its income. This has been wilfully ignored by successive governments, creating a hostile economic environment for entrepreneurs in recent years.\n\nGraham’s optimistic and considered political views advocate a move away from mangled Keynesian group-think ideas around money printing, high taxation and expanded public spending to stimulate growth. On climate change, he supports a rational decarbonisation policy, which takes full account the UK’s carbon abatement costs, without leaning on the dishonest policies of offshoring of our heavy industry & carbon footprint.\n\nHe believes that young people deserve better opportunities through structured apprenticeships and a shake-up of our poor-quality, overly expensive university system, which prioritises high-paying, foreign students over British students. Rewarding young voters who are willing to invest in themselves should be a key priority of this next government.\n\nGraham’s decision to stand for election with Reform-UK stems from a profound belief that a new approach is required. His aim is to re-engage the people of Godalming & Ash into the political process and encourage Surrey voters to reject the declinist narrative by voting for a party which advocates positive change.",

As a single mum for the majority of my life, I can definitely say that I have had my fair share of these moments. I appreciate the diversity of life and the many obstacles that have been thrown my way and the many doors that have opened and closed.\n\nIt is by making mistakes, that I have learned I can get through anything and that I can always try again. It is by dealing with so many challenges, that I have learned how courageous and resilient I am. It is by recognising my achievements, that makes me desire to be the best I can be and to always push for what I want.\n\nIn today's Britain it has become harder and harder to plan for the future, to reach for our dreams and to live life in a way that is progressive and fruitful. The majority of us, are in survival mode and we are living to try and survive instead of having much quality to life and this is seemingly getting worse and worse. As a mother, I want my children to feel like they can push for a dream and enjoy a holiday or two and not have to worry about whether the cost-of-living crisis is going to affect us even more each year.\n\nWe live in a first world country and yet we can't enjoy a suitable standard of life because we struggle to keep warm, fill our cupboards, get NHS appointments and find suitable housing.\n\nThe two most important things we have in life are Freedom and Security and it is my honour to fight for these. Without our freedom of speech and freedom of choice, we are just numbers. We have no purpose if we can't express ourselves and if we all have to think the same way. Without security, anything can happen at any moment and I think it is shocking that more people do not care about this.\n\nI wanted to be a Lawyer, a mother and an actress and the older I got, the more I realised that life was not what I thought. Sitting in school and being told what to read, what to write about, what to think and to choose what I wanted to be when I grew up, seemed more and more like a waste of time as I left school and entered the real world. Nothing really prepares you for life’s many decisions and challenges. The responsibilities of becoming an adult and becoming a parent are not really what school teaches you.\n\nAs the years go by, I realise more and more how important it is to focus on who is trying to make the bigger decisions about my life. No matter what doors I go through, what mistakes I make or what I achieve, it can only take me so far. It is the decisions that those in power make, that effect my life greatly and this is something that I want to make people aware of.\n\nWe all deserve a better way of living; our children and grandchildren deserve a brighter and more secure future and our ancestors certainly didn't serve in the wars to watch us lose our freedoms and struggle for a life worth living for.\n\nSo, if like me, you see the bigger picture and you have had enough of struggling and fearing for the future, then help me make a difference. A vote for me is a vote for something different, is a vote for change and courage. Voting for me helps me to restore some safety and hope to many people. I will always stand up for what I think is right and I will always make sure our voices are heard.",

Since then I have very much made Lincolnshire my home.\n\nIn recent years, I became active politically during the Brexit campaign, something I feel very passionately about. Since then, seeing the political classes virtually ruin our country through incompetence, it has encouraged me to stand up and try to do something about it.\n\nI have become very interested in preserving Lincolnshire’s rural society, and maintaining our identity as a major agricultural area of the UK.\n\nOur local economy is suffering, this is not good enough and we must protect it.\n\nEvery day I see how the agricultural industry has to cope with more and more financial and regulatory pressure.\n\nI also see how we are increasingly being asked /told to sacrifice our precious Agricultural land to Solar and Wind farms, plus the disruptive infrastructure needed to support them.\n\nIt is obvious that our local NHS, Dentists and social care services have been struggling to keep up their great work in sustaining our health and well being. The NHS really does need proper attention, not just a quick sprinkling with cash to placate the electorate before an election. We have a plan to deal with this.\n\nDefence, border control and policing are increasingly vital in keeping us safe and preventing crime. We have seen our defence budgets cut, our service recruitment succumb to woke ideology, and front line policing suffer due to similar issues.\n\nAlso, as part of the solutions to these issues, I believe that we should be reconfiguring the judicial system to actually deal with criminals, rather than merely finding excuses as to why they should not serve jail sentences.\n\nThe towns, villages and farms of our county are unique. We are spread over a large (often rural) geographical area, and therefore we must have suitable provision for law and order. I want to see our area get the investment and actions which will offer us a more comprehensive and less exhausted police force.\n\nI believe that we should be preparing our children for real life; so I also believe that our education system needs to reinforce this aim. I want to see our entire education system concentrate of education, rather than certain so called “Woke” ideology which can harm children.\n\nWe already know that school life can be hard for both children and teachers. What better way to de stress school time for all than to remove these ideologies and fads from our schools? This is something which I believe needs to happen as soon as possible.\n\nWe have a unique road system in our county. Often remote, poorly maintained, frequently dangerous and definitely full of deep potholes. I want to see exactly what has gone wrong. Where has all the government funding for potholes gone? Why do we not see any improvement?\n\nFollowing recent flooding events around here, I have taken a special interest in finding out why our drainage system is not functioning as it should.\n\nAgain, investment by those responsible seems to be the key, but I am still looking at it in detail.\n\nWhy do we need to have so much housing stock built around here, when our drainage system, our water supply and our infrastructure is on the edge of collapse? Many of us don’t even get a bus service!\n\nHere at Reform UK we believe that taxes should be a low as they possibly can be, and that you should not be subsidising Net Zero or so called Green energy projects to the tune of 25% of your energy/fuel bills. We also think that no one should pay any income tax at all on the first £20,000 of their earnings.\n\nWe want to reduce car fuel duty to encourage our economy even further.\n\nGive my colleagues and I a majority of the votes at the next General Election, and those are just a few of the things we want to do for you.\n\nI am very keen to represent you the voter. Something which has not happened for decades in this constituency. To do that I will need tour help (and your vote!).\n\nPlease do tell me your thoughts. I need you to tell me what you think is needed. I am not here to tell you what I think is best for you. I want to make politics fair, representative and more accessible to voters. Please help me to do all this for the Grantham and Bourne Constituency.\n\nPlease help me do all this for you.\n\nIf you would like to volunteer for Reform UK or be a fundraiser, please visit our website or contact me directly.\n\nWelcome to a better way for Britain. Reform UK, don’t just hope for it, vote for it!",

Having left school at 16 and joined the Army as a boy soldier, where I served 8 years as a Royal Military Policeman, in several spheres including BAOR, The Falkland Islands (post conflict) and Northern Ireland; followed by several successful  jobs in corporate life all around the Manchester area; my amazing wife and I decided to go into business for ourselves, where we have enjoyed some moderate success.\n\nAs a Veteran, I can no longer stand back and continue to watch knuckle pointing, ‘career’ politicians, who punctuate with ‘let me be clear’ & ‘we have been very clear’ etc, (whilst being anything but clear), many of whom have never worked a ‘normal’ job in their entire lives, run this country into the ground. All whilst lining their own pockets and rewarding each other and their ‘lackies’ with peerages for doing a woeful job!  Just to then hand the baton back to the opposite side of the House for history to repeat itself.\n\nFor that and many, many other reasons such as uncontrolled immigration, a Broken Health system, national security, the cost-of-living crisis (which just seems to be exploited by major retailers), the list just goes on! we need Radical change and the only way that can happen is if each and every one of us is prepared to stand up and be counted.\n\nRight now, until YOU vote for a radical change, under the current ‘Tribal’ 1st past the post voting system the process will always be rigged in favour of the 2-party system, which is why the only other country in Europe to use this system is Belarus!  Do we really call that democratic?  For true democracy, and for true and radical change we need Proportionate representation, which the current ruling parties will never allow, as it’s not in the interest of either party!\n\nWell, I for one am not prepared to stand back and watch my children & grandchildren have to face the same 2 woeful options for parliament that we are faced with today, where a ‘dull’ largely silent Labour party with no discernible solutions are polling a huge majority because the former alternative is so, indescribably poor.\n\nThis is, I believe a pivotal time in our country’s history, where every single vote counts.  Whilst the other parties want you to think that a vote for reform is a wasted vote, just look at the poles! Reform get stronger every day, and are the true party of opposition; where as in my opinion, a vote for either of the other 2 parties is a vote for “Same S***, different day!”\n\nFor real democracy, vote Reform.",

For one fabulous summer I was a lifeguard in Hitchin’s outdoor swimming pool.\n\nMy wife, Suzie, was both a pupil and teacher at Hitchin Girls' School until her retirement. My three children were educated locally in Hitchin, Letchworth, and Baldock.\n\nAfter a period in banking, I qualified as a chartered accountant and spent most of my career in international corporate finance, working in technology start-ups (including green technologies), turnaround and recovery situations. Until a year ago, I ran the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester, famous for its links to Rupert Brooke and the Bloomsbury Set.\n\nI served two terms as a non-executive director of the QEII Hospital in Welwyn Garden City. Over a five-year period, this hospital was the best performing in the region with a 25% increase in Completed Patient Episodes for a 5% increase in real income. It is on record that I was strongly opposed to the merger of the Lister and QEII hospitals because it was obvious that we needed more, and not less capacity, in our NHS. I think I have been proved right! To me, solving the problems of the NHS are not a matter of theory as they are with many candidates. I know the issues involved and have helped to address them. And they are not all about money!\n\nI am also a former Chairman of the Board of Governors of both Regent’s College and the European Business School. I helped rescue both these educational colleges from bankruptcy and helped set them on the path to becoming Regent’s University in the middle of Regents Park. This means that I fully understand the problems our universities are now facing as our students realise that the price / benefit ratio of many university degrees has turned negative.\n\nI was the founding chairman of the Hitchin and Harpenden Conservative Association. Thanks to the hard work and enthusiasm of many others, it became one of the most successful associations within the Conservative Party. Sadly, for our country, the Conservative Party today is a shadow of its former self, hence the need for Reform UK. It is my contention that I have not left the Conservative Party. It left me!\n\nI was the Parliamentary Candidate for the Brexit Party in Bedford in the 2019 General Election. A salutary and sobering experience.\n\nI have published four historical novels in the de Gressier and am regular contributor of essays and pamphlets on Substack.\n\nIf, like me, you are fed up with the state our politics and believe that the two-party system has run its course then do get involved.

I enjoy watching football and think of myself as an ordinary guy who is fed up of the lies and repeated failures of the major parties. We need Reform!\n\nWhy am I standing for ReformUK?\n\nReform UK is the only political party that is committed to scrapping Net Zero. Ordinary members of the public are the people who must pay ridiculously higher fuel prices to fund the various schemes to reduce our carbon footprint, even as China pumps ever more emissions into the atmosphere. We offshore our problems instead of dealing with them.\n\nThe war on the motorist is another of these elite schemes. LTNs, low emission zones, 15-minute cities, speed cameras, inflated parking charges, all this takes ever more money off the average road user, as they dodge the potholes. Next it will be road pricing with even more charges and even more cameras. But who has seen any improvement in public transport as people are forced out of their cars? Scrapping Net Zero will also help us gain Energy and Food Independence.\n\nI am horrified at the continual attack on Free Speech especially by SNP and Labour. Recent governments have sat and watched as universities, schools, the media, the public sector, and big companies, have been taken over by woke bigots who decide what you are allowed to say in public and in even your own home in Scotland under the shelved Named Person Scheme and enacted in the Hate Crime Bill. This is an assault on the liberty which we in this country have enjoyed for hundreds of years. Reform is tired of identity politics, and stands up for the right of ordinary, decent people to think and speak as they wish. \n\nPlease vote for me and together we can make Great Britain into a country we can all be proud to call home.",

Below is short summary of his background.\n\nI was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, in June 1955. My father was in the Royal Navy for 17 years, joining as an artificer and leaving as a Chief Petty Officer. The family were shuffled from one port to another, mostly along the south coast although I did live for a short time, aged six months, in a flat above a chip shop, near the lighthouse in Harwich!\n\nChildren of naval servicemen in the 1960s were eligible to attend The Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, Suffolk. These were the most important years of my life where I was transformed from a toerag into an acceptable human being. Mental arithmetic was my strongest attribute and aged nineteen I was working in the Playboy Casino in Park Lane, London.\n\nI was there for seven years as a Dealer and then Inspector of Blackjack, Roulette and Punto Banco (similar to Chemin de Fer) before training croupiers to do the same. When the Playboy Casino closed I moved to a casino in Hans St (SW3) which then relocated to Curzon St, Mayfair.\n\nIn 1987 I opened my first Licensed Betting Office in Haslemere, Surrey and spent the next 30 years as an independent bookmaker. Eventually regulatory costs and internet competition overwhelmed the ‘independents’ and I closed my last shop in Liphook, Hampshire in August 2018. I then moved to Felixstowe and now have an antique shop in the town, on the High Street.\n\nPolitically, I was selected to stand for the Brexit Party in the Suffolk Coastal constituency in the 2019 general election. We had the only Brexit Shop in the country in Hamilton Road, Felixstowe, where we spoke to hundreds of electors from all sides of the political debate.\n\nThe Brexit Party stood many of their candidates down but our team collectively decided I should continue as an Independent. During the campaign we had promised to stand up for those who felt disenfranchised.\n\nAt the Brexit Party we were attracting Labour voters hand over fist, many of those who came to speak with us came from Ipswich. It was sad to see so much unhappiness. This Conservative Government was handed a huge mandate by the voters of this country to implement the Brexit that we voted for in the Referendum. They have failed entirely.\n\nThey have most certainly failed the people of Ipswich. I feel strongly that the Reform Party will stand up for the people of Ipswich and not treat them as expendable. Both Labour and the Conservatives are culpable when it comes to making promises they do not keep, even worse, do not intend to keep.\n\nI am in a long term relationship, previously having been married for eighteen years having three adult children. My Mother has lived in Nacton for over 30 years during which time she has been Chairman of The League of Friends for Ipswich Hospital.\n\nFor three successive years I ran a football competition in conjunction with The League of Friends, Ipswich Town FC and Orwell Park School to raise money for the cause. I feel privileged to represent the Reform Party in Ipswich and to demonstrate our intention to represent you - The People.",

I hold Christian values but am not religious myself. I believe we should support small business to compete on a level playing field and the Farming community to farm and produce food for us, with strong subsidies tailored to regional farmers requirement. Housing should go to local people first, along with this supporting the community, with initiatives to help the elderly and vulnerable.  I believe in the NHS, though I think that some reforms are needed, I stand for controlling our borders, I am not against immigration but believe we should choose who comes to our great nation.

They have run out of ideas, lack the determination to get the UK back on track and work for the working class people.\n\nThe immense challenges are ahead and except Reform UK, no other party has any Common Sense solutions to \"Make Britain Great Again\"!\n\nI want to reshape and reform the UK, and get it back on track.\n\nRishi Sunak and all other Conservative PMs for the last 13 years have shown poor leadership. Recently, they have failed to work on the mandate given by the general people in 2019 and in previous general elections. Their policies and laws have brought devastating impacts on hard working people, businesses.\n\nI am standing as an Prospective Parliamentary Candidate at Ilford South Constituency in Redbridge with Reform UK on behalf of the residents because like many of you I am frustrated, worried, tremendously concern about the current situations in Ilford South, Redbridge as:\n\nInflation is super high,\n\nMortgage rates are hitting the hard working people,\n\nULEZ introduction is hitting many of you,\n\nCrimes are in high rates,\n\nResidents safety is at critical conditions,\n\nWomen going out on roads day or night - do not feel safe any more,\n\nAnti-social behaviors are in rocket-high,\n\nSmall businesses are suffering,\n\nPeople are struggling with GP and hospital appointments,\n\nGreen spaces in Ilford South, Redbridge are vanishing month by month,\n\nParents are not getting proper support and education for their children,\n\nRoads are dirty, full of potholes,\n\nYoung generations are not getting the right jobs nor getting paid enough with their gained degrees or experiences,\n\nand many other local issues\n\nI strongly believe Ilford South constituency residents deserve a modern, beautiful and lawful constituency under a strong, visionary MP’s leadership.

Which, in practice means being on the side of 90% of the public and business.\n\nThere’s a tension in Huntingdonshire towns between the pro-car public and local businesses and the anti-car councils. Local government keeps finding new ways to prevent people from using their cars to go shopping, go to work, visit the doctor and so on. Whereas local businesses know that more parking is good for business and for attracting employees. \n\nThe council’s neglect of B roads and the resulting epidemic of craters and potholes, makes life difficult and hazardous for anyone living or working in villages. It has also contributed to rocketing car insurance and overstretched road-side assistance services. Yet those same councils always have enough money for installing traffic calming chicanes, humps and unnecessary 20mph zones.\n\nI would like to see lower car parking charges and free parking and more of it in our towns, and to see the state of our roads prioritised.\n\nI also think reductions in business rates and a bonfire of regulation would enable local business and the local economy to thrive.\n\nMy tenets\n\nFree speech – all opinions should be allowed to compete in the marketplace of ideas.

From an early age, Navdeep was deeply influenced by the values of community service and social justice, which were integral to his upbringing. In 2005, Navdeep made the significant decision to move to the United Kingdom, seeking new opportunities and a platform to further his commitment to social activism.\n\nProfessional Journey:\n\nNavdeep's professional career began in the construction industry, where he quickly rose to leadership positions. He served as a Director at Sandhu Construction Ltd from August 2008 to February 2021, showcasing his adeptness in management and strategic planning. He then took on the role of Director at Navco Builder Merchant from March 2016 to June 2023, further solidifying his reputation as a capable and effective leader.

He has been instrumental in organizing and leading numerous campaigns addressing critical issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and unnecessary taxation on the working class. Notably, Navdeep organized a week-long hunger strike in August 2022 at Reading Station to support Prabhdeep Singh, raising awareness about the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nHis activism extends to environmental and transportation policies, where he has been a vocal opponent of restrictive measures like the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), Low Emission Zone (LEZ), Clean Air Zone (CAZ), and congestion charges. In August 2023, he participated in another week-long hunger strike at Uxbridge Underground Station, and in September 2023, he joined a mass hunger strike outside Sadiq Khan’s residence in Tooting, both aimed at opposing ULEZ expansion.\n\nLeadership and Advocacy:\n\nNavdeep has spearheaded efforts to raise awareness about the adverse effects of these restrictive measures on the working class. His leadership and advocacy have mobilized communities and engaged local authorities, fostering a deeper understanding of these pressing issues.\n\nRespected Community Figure:\n\nOver the past two decades, Navdeep has dedicatedly served the Sikh community in the UK, earning recognition as a respected figure.

My interests include live entertainment (I am a patron of the Concordia Theatre), discovering new places with my touring caravan, and reading railway and social history. I also support local animal rescue organizations, and I have adopted several older rescue dogs.\n\nWhy am I standing as PPC for Hinckley and Bosworth?\n\nI love my country and I am not happy with the way it is being governed. I hold the strong belief that we are a sovereign and island nation, and that we should not be governed by any foreign court or organization. I recognize that the inevitable cycle of alternating Team Red and Team Blue at Westminster is a cycle doomed to failure. Both parties have proved unreliable, and both are distracted by interminable and counter-productive internal disagreements. Over the years, neither party has proved willing or capable of offering what we, the electorate, wants and voted for.\n\nOwing to this regrettable state of affairs, today it is difficult to find anything in our country which is not broken or which is still fit for purpose. For example - Border Control, the Police, the N.H.S., the Economy, suitable support for Veterans, Cost of Living, Pensions, Employment, Education, etc. The current High Tax and Low Growth policy is unsustainable, and we are seeing our country and our way of life being ruined. We are a democracy, but we are not getting the government that we deserve. Reform UK is the alternative that can help us to achieve a better life.\n\nThrough Reform UK, I want to help turn our country around. To stop the rot. To bring back prosperity to our country. To mend broken Britain. I am standing as a candidate for Reform UK, because it is the only party that recognizes that we need to examine all our main institutions and work out how they can be restructured and revitalized to meet our needs and how these changes can realistically be financed – as detailed in our equivalent of a manifesto called ‘Our Contract with You’ on the party website. Click the link to view it at: https://www.reformparty.uk/policies\n\nAs your Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Hinckley and Bosworth Constituency, I consider myself very fortunate to have this opportunity to work towards these goals.  I believe we can save Britain and make our lives better. A vote for Reform UK is a vote for change - change for the better.\n\nAn M.P. has an important role in national government, but also has a duty to represent all constituents at a local level. I have lived in Barwell for the past 8 years, so I have genuine local knowledge of the main concerns and problems we face in the constituency where I am standing for election. I know, for example, that there are particular issues concerning the expansion of towns and villages without the infrastructure and facilities being upgraded, thus increasing the pressure on the existing infrastructure and facilities, the present planning system is broken, it ignores cumulative effect of developments and the true need for major road improvements, new schools and G.P. Surgeries, I shall do my best to fight for a common sense, fair and balanced revision of the Planning Laws.\n\nI became active in mainstream politics when the Brexit Party was formed. I became a member, and later held the position of Bosworth Constituency Coordinator. When the Brexit Party became Reform UK, I transferred my membership. I have previously served for 10 years as an independent parish councilor, recently I have been a candidate for Reform UK in both the County Council and Borough Council Elections.\n\nNow I am hoping that you will support me to act for you on a national level as your Constituency M.P., because, to quote our party, ‘Britain needs Reform and Reform needs You’. It can be done, and I really believe we can do it.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments or wish to offer support, I look forward to hearing from you.",

My career has been spent in the IT industry with large companies like IBM and HP, as well as smaller companies and start up tech businesses. I am now an adviser to several tech businesses.\n\nHove has been my home for most of my life. It’s a great place to live but could be so much better if we didn’t have a Green or Labour run council focusing on the wrong things.\n\nI am a passionate Albion season ticket holder and a keen follower of Sussex cricket.\n\nI found myself politically homeless 4 years ago. As a lover of freedom, I felt the continued lockdown of the country was unnecessary and ruinous to the future of our country in so many ways. The way that the state and all the levers of power worked together to frighten the population into submission has left a lasting negative impression on me.\n\nI was a lifelong Conservative voter but feel the Tories have totally lost their way. They have made my country a much worse place in which to live. A Labour government will make it even worse.\n\nI don’t see myself as a politician but rather I am a very concerned citizen of the UK. I am very worried about the direction the country has taken and will continue to take if we don’t make dramatic changes to our direction of travel. That is why I am standing for the Reform party. They are the only party with the clarity and courage to put us back on the right path.\n\nBeliefs\n\nI believe in the values that have emerged in Britain over many hundred years; freedom, decency, tolerance, the rule of law.  We have been a positive beacon to the world.\n\nWe need a vibrant enterprise led economy, with low taxation and rewards for those in work.\n\nThe public sector has got far too large and needs a concerted effort to reduce its size.\n\nThe level of legal (and illegal) net immigration is totally unsustainable at over 700,000 a year. This needs to be significantly reduced. Some immigration is good but the public services cant cope with the current level. It is also seriously jeopardising social cohesion.\n\nWe must attack wokeness which is so prevalent in the public sector and big business. The extremists of the gender war need to be stood up to. The wokerati have made us a more colour conscious society through their obsession with white guilt and critical race theory. I don’t believe in this at all, and it must be stopped.\n\nA big negative impact of this cultural wokeness has been the public’s declining respect for the police. It feels that it has become politicised and is focusing on the wrong things; so, called ‘hate crimes’ instead of real crimes. The police need an overhaul. They need to reprioritise and get really tough on the knife crime epidemic, burglary and shop lifting and general thuggish anti-social behaviour.\n\nI am against net zero. It hasn’t been thought through and will significantly weaken our economy and hurt those least able to pay for this middle-class luxury. It has become a secular religion. Common sense needs to come back into the debate.\n\nThe NHS has been failing for many years to adapt to the requirements of modern society. Both parties have politicised debate on the NHS and both have failed it. It needs radical reform not more money.\n\nLocally\n\nMy biggest issue locally is the pollution of our sea with regular discharges of sewage by Southern Water. I am an all-year-round swimmer and am disgusted that in 2023 we can’t swim off our beach in Hove for fear of being made ill through sewage.\n\nThe clamping down on graffiti; weeding the pavements; fixing pot holes and making the city a fantastic pro-business City would also be priorities.",

I have completed advanced policing leadership courses and obtained CMI qualifications, enhancing my leadership skills and strategic capabilities.\n\nMoreover, my tenure as a District Councillor for eight years has provided me with a nuanced understanding of local governance and the intricacies of policy-making at the grassroots level.\n\nEducation has been a cornerstone of my professional development, culminating in a LLB (law degree) and Legal Practice Certificate, alongside numerous professional qualifications. However, my decision to enter public service was fuelled not only by academic pursuit but by a profound sense of duty to my community—a commitment that was further galvanised by my battle with cancer, which underscored the importance of giving back and effecting positive change.\n\nMy involvement in various charitable endeavours, including The Adventure Corp, St John Ambulance, and Warwickshire Search and Rescue, reflects my enduring dedication to community welfare and inclusivity. Notably, I am immensely proud to have received the George Cross - NHS from the late Queen, in recognition of my frontline service as a nurse during the challenging period of the Covid pandemic.\n\nAs a member of Warwickshire Search and Rescue, we have as a body been honoured with The King's Award for Voluntary Service, a testament to the transformative power of collective action and civic engagement.\n\nWith a wealth of experience garnered from working at local, regional, and national levels, I stand poised to be your voice and advocate for meaningful reform. The challenges we face—from neglected public services to the soaring cost of living—demand bold, pragmatic solutions. Reform UK offers a clear path forward, one that prioritises revitalising our public services, cracking down on unchecked immigration, reducing burdensome taxes, and alleviating the strain of the cost of living crisis.\n\nI am committed to championing these causes and ensuring that the voices of Kenilworth and Southam are heard loud and clear. Together, let us forge a future defined by progress, prosperity, and real change.\n\nThank you for your trust and support.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Growing up in a mining village in Ayrshire I have had a typical working-class upbringing. This has given me a common sense approach to issues and a very practical mind-set. Leaving school at 15 and working many hard physical jobs in my early life including farming, fishing and the building trade has given me a good appreciation of the value of hard work and self-reliance. Later, working in engineering companies such as John Brown focused my ambitions and I now work as a professional engineer after obtaining an engineering degree as a mature student.  I was lucky to be old enough not to be indoctrinated with the current anti-British ideology which we so frequently see in these institutions today. I have travelled extensively throughout many countries across the globe over the years. I believe experiencing different cultures has given me a great appreciation of my own culture which I previously took for granted and has imbued me with a willingness to preserve it in the face of creeping global collectivisation. I am a keen hillwalker who has climbed all of our Scottish Munros along with many hills in other places and enjoy swimming on our beautiful beaches on the west coast.\n\nWhy did I choose to stand for reform UK?\n\nI am standing for reform UK because I am fed up of our current political class who are simply not interested in doing anything for the benefit of the people in our country. They are continually talking the UK down and during the Brexit negotiations were so visibly weak and made concessions to the European Union over things like our fishing waters and our ability to create our own human rights laws. The three stand out items for me are the reform of our voting system with a PR option, for too long it has been the case that if your preferred party had a low share of the vote in your constituency then your preference of party was not represented in the government which was then elected.\n\nThe second item for me is the reform of the House of Lords; this unelected group have been given peerages by governments of the past due to their political leanings, and in this way the policies of these previous governments expressed via the Lords only serves to curtail the ability of the current government to react to the wishes of the electorate. By design, the Lords are always out of step with the current wishes of the British public.\n\nThe third item is the reform of the BBC licence fee, As the policy states, “no taxation without representation”, and this fixed cost per household is a far bigger percentage of a low-income household than a high-income household and as such is an undue hardship for many poorer people who don’t have as many alternative forms of entertainment as those who are well off.  In my view the elections should not be some sort of talent contest where we vote for whoever comes out with the most entertaining lines. We should be voting for someone who actually wants to do what is right for the people of this country and who will work to implement the policies which are written in their party manifesto. I believe I am that person.",

Reform UK are the right party to make a real change. \n\nJOIN REFORM UK TODAY \n\nLet's Make Britain Great We can make Britain great again.\n\nTo do this, reform is essential in the way our country is run and managed, so it works properly for the people.\n\nIn many areas, just the application of basic common sense would be a good start! The nation faces many challenges, but we can overcome them. To succeed, we need to do Brexit properly. We must grow our way out of the crisis, we cannot tax our way out of it. We must stand up for our core democratic values, our civil liberties, our right to free speech.\n\nLet’s celebrate our pride in being British: our amazing culture, our unbreakable communities, our incredible heritage. Let’s stop all the woke nonsense that is holding us back. Let’s have a proper immigration policy that works for our country and protects our borders. Together, let’s make great things happen!\n\nReform is essential in these key areas: 1. Reform our Economy: \n\nTo succeed faster growth is vital.\n\nHigher growth rates are the only way to better wages and more tax revenues that can be invested in better healthcare and other public services.\n\nOur bold economic vision frees up over 6 million people from paying Income Tax and frees up over 1.2 million small businesses and self-employed from paying Corporation Tax.\n\nWe would also aim to remove a raft of other stifling taxes in a responsible, timely way.\n\nThis will generate much faster growth than seen in recent decades.\n\nWe must also stop wasting taxpayers money... Read more\n\n2. Reform our Energy Strategy: \n\nWe all care about the environment and want cleaner air, and we can do this in a strategic, affordable way. Yet the Westminster Net Zero plan is making us all net poorer whilst creating more emissions overall as it outsources them overseas. It is therefore net stupid.\n\nIt is adding huge extra costs to us all as consumers and to our businesses. This will send hundreds of thousands of British jobs to China and elsewhere. Our energy plan will use our own energy treasure under our feet, and create thousands of British jobs, by making our industries competitive again.\n\nIt will save consumers considerable amounts of money on their bills every year. We would also nationalise 50% of key utility companies to stop consumers being ripped off with the other 50% being owned by British pension funds for British pensioners... Read more\n\n3. Reform our Public Sector: \n\nWe must be ambitious, seeking faster, more efficient public services that work better for us all.\n\nFor example, with health, we should demand zero waiting lists and we have a bold plan to achieve this vision. Our police need to focus on preventing crime and catching criminals.\n\nOur schools must educate our children properly to prepare them for a competitive, challenging world. Our Border Force must protect our borders... Read more\n\n4. Reform our Institutions: \n\nMajor change is needed to the bodies that impact our lives — the unelected cronyism of the House of Lords, the unaccountable civil service and the bloated BBC.\n\nReform is essential to our voting system so it is fairer and more representative; the two-party system embeds the status quo and prevents real change...

In which I orchestrated a meeting between the group and SELRAP, the organization that is responsible for campaigning for the re-opening of the Colne to Skipton Rail line, the presentation highlighted the enormous benefits on reopening this line for our region as well as the entire north of England and I whole heartedly support their endeavours.\n\n*Member of the Planning committee.\n\n*Public spaces and assets committee.\n\n*Representative on the Yorkshire Local Council Association.\n\n*Chair of Governors of 2 primary schools in the area.\n\n*Council appointed to Beckfoot Nessfield local school committee. \n\nAs these active and varied roles, I see the issues the local area and its people face in these testing times. I am very aware for a need to build more homes, but at what cost to those already residing in the area?\n\nWe are witnessing too many large scale developments in areas such as Silsden and Oakworth for example, yet our infrastructure and schools are not being developed accordingly, Leading to oversubscribed schools, Roads that cannot cope with the rise in traffic numbers, Doctor's appointment's being near unobtainable, The list goes on, We all feel this in our basic day to day lives and something needs to change, this needs to be addressed.\n\nOne of my actions if elected would be to strongly lobby to prohibit HGV vehicles from using the town of Silsden cut through to Ilkley and beyond, aiming to make an “access only” policy for HGVs, small towns with primary schools and a very narrow town centre are not a place for 20 tonne wagons.\n\nThere is absolutely no need for these large rumbling polluting dangerous vehicles to take this route as the trunk road and main roads on the outskirts of Skipton to Addingham to Ilkley are more that capable of taking them with very little time added to the journey, this is an action of financial gain over local wellbeing.\n\nI have undertaken the role of Chair of governors as I feel the correct education of our young is paramount in this ever-changing world, it is the young who will shape the future of the world we live in today, I believe education should be for-filling, fun and rewarding, It is too easy to loose young minds interest if education becomes stale.\n\nI believe to make the changes most people are crying out for in this constituency we need to start from grassroots, work from the ground up, what we do today effects the tomorrow, there are many more issues that our towns and countryside face, We all know these, we experience and talk about them on a daily basis, from Oakworth to Ilkley, (far too many to mention here) and the challenge is to identify the issues which matter to you as an individual or a whole village or town, I would like to take on this challenge and put my 100% in as I do the roles I already carry out successfully on behalf of the town of Keighley and it's residents I would like to broaden the use of my abilities and improve the wider area at the request of the constituents, I can only do this once appointed to the position of Member of Parliament for those who willed me there.\n\nI am \"I am reliably informed\" very approachable as a person I currently work very well with many local organisations and communities.\n\nCrime and anti-social behaviour are high on the list of concerns of the residents I have spoken to, and I will lobby to get a permanent police presence in Keighley, the town is the tenth largest civil parish in the country with a population of over 57.000. An accessible police station in the heart of Keighley is essential.\n\nIf I take on a role whether appointed, voted or indeed pushed,\n\nI give the position my all, Once tasked with a mission, I see it through to the end.\n\nI will sum up by stating that it is my belief Government and Members of Parliament have a responsibility to give you the life you deserve, which should be a happy fulfilled life. The role of Government is not to tell you how to live that life.\n\nThank you for your time.",

We all instinctively know it's now time for change, so when I was asked to be the Reform UK parliamentary candidate for Knowsley, I knew it was time for me to make a stand for what matters to us all, and proudly accept the challenge. I pledge to focus on six main areas to improve the outlook for my children as well as yours. 1. Net Zero Immigration - introduce fair and compassionate policies to welcome those with skills who can contribute to our society, while providing a safe haven to those who genuinely seek asylum. To achieve this, we must also regain control of our borders and put an end to illegal migration and punish those who facilitate this inhumane business. 2. Political Reform - It is time to start the revolt against the two-party system and demand real change by introducing proportional representation. This will ensure that we each have a voice to hold our government to account. 3. Mental Health – our country is in the grip of a mental health epidemic following the social effects caused by lock down and COVID. Our children are now pressurised to grow up too fast by social media and woke ideologies. Waiting times to access critical mental health services are keeping people out of work and education, causing further strain on services and society. 4. Lower Taxes - the individual tax burden is at its highest for seventy years. We must cut public sector waste, reform our bureaucratic and inefficient services, and remove unproductive non-jobs and middle management costs. Then we can focus again on delivering world class front line services (nurses, doctors, police, dentists etc). 5. Lower Energy Prices – we must make full use of our natural oil and gas reserves, embrace nuclear technologies, and remove subsidies to so-called \"green\" technologies. We need Great Britain to become energy self-sufficient to insulate ourselves from the unstable global political stage. The impact of energy prices to our households has been inexcusable. 6. Sustainable Environment Policies - Over the past two decades I have fought to preserve our few remaining green spaces in Knowsley, and have consistently championed environmental issues that impact us all. This is a subject that I remain passionate about but have the pragmatism to know that we must approach the complex subject of preserving nature without undermining our already shattered economy and adding further pressure to the cost-of-living crisis that is hitting all our pockets. Net Zero is making us poorer and colder, damaging British industry and forcing motorists off the road. Let's put Britain first and stop the unethical and illogical trade of carbon emissions to poorer countries. See you on the campaign trail and remember your photographic ID on Thursday 4th July!",

The current leadership of both are destined failures, who truly don’t deserve our vote.\n\nThis Tory government is actively harming our country, destroying our history, heritage and consider themselves above scrutiny and accountability.\n\nThis Labour party have proved themselves a poor opposition, weak and ineffectual whilst at times acting in unison with government policies that have been detrimental to the people to our United Kingdom.\n\nWe need drastic change for the better in the 2024 general election, Our United Kingdom needs to elect as many people from outside the 2 main parties as possible, the circle does not have an automatic right to govern our country and change is now possible.\n\nFor a number of years now, I have watched Luton Labour play diversity and division politics, and with a clear lack of opposition to push back on their policies, it leaves many Luton North Residents in desperate need of representation because they won’t & don’t support Labour and can no longer offer support to the Conservative party.\n\nWith that, I am delighted to be selected as the Reform UK PPC for Luton North, I believe Reform UK are the only common-sense option in the room and come General Election time it will be clear that Reform UK are the only party listening to the people.\n\nI have been a Luton North Resident for 8years, I live here with my family who work and go to school in Luton.  Luton North is my home. \n\nLuton North deserve a candidate that understands the issues they are facing.\n\nLuton North needs an MP who will challenge this lazy Labour run local council, an MP prepared to challenge Labour’s vested interests, an MP who will challenge, not cover-up, Labour wrongdoing, an MP that will be a voice and representative for all of Luton.\n\nWe will need stronger representation in Parliament if we want a Safer Luton, a Fairer Luton and a Luton we want to be proud of.\n\nI am fully committed to ditching Net Zero and will campaign to give people a choice on this via a referendum.\n\nI am fully committed to ditching the woke agenda engulfing us all.\n\nI am fully committed to highlighting corruption and negligence in public office.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for secure, safe and clean streets.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for an honesty, transparency and common sense.\n\nA vote for me is a vote against closed shop politics.\n\nA vote for me is a vote against Net Zero, DEI and Woke Politics.\n\nA vote for me is a vote to Save our Country and Take it Back.\n\nI would never presume to know every issue of the area, but I would give 100% time and commitment to assist with the most compelling and identified electorate issues that arise, giving a voice to every single person who needs it, or wants it.\n\nI will support local community organisations to be strong and successful. creating a fairer Luton North where every community thrives.\n\nI will campaign to make extra funding available to increase activity/educational programs at community/drop-in centres for young adults whilst demanding greater support and services from government at a pivotal time in their lives.\n\nI will campaign to make extra funding available for SEN & SEND schools in Luton North giving children with learning difficulties much greater help in there early years.\n\nI will campaign for better quality services, a better transport network and increased investment for our local parks and green spaces.\n\nI will acknowledge the homeless/begging problem on the streets of Luton North and put in place plans to tackle this issue.\n\nI will solve the pothole problem that plague’s roads in Luton North. \n\nI will be visible and accessible to all residents of Luton North and put the community needs at the forefront of any decisions made that will affect them.",

Or do they want a party who will do what the voters have asked for.\n\nThe reason I voted for Brexit was to reclaim British sovereignty. ReformUK want to reject the influence of the World Economic Forum and cancel membership of the World Health Organisation. They also oppose the creation of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which could stop us gaining access to our bank accounts, or tell us we have a certain amount of time to spend the money in our bank account, or we would lose it. The globalists also want to impose 15 minute cities on us and restrict our freedom to travel. At this election we have an opportunity to fight for our freedoms.\n\nAs a teacher I would like to see smart phones banned in schools. Young people are becoming addicted to their phones and have very little attention span. This effects their learning. Phones can be used to bully their peers and adults can use it to push things like transgender ideology and Critical Race Theory on vulnerable young people. ReformUK wants to deal with this by launching inquiries into these issues.\n\nI am also concerned about the rise in knife crime and crime in general in London. ReformUK want to increase the number of police and get police back to fighting crime, rather than policing comments made on social media and promoting the woke agenda.\n\nReformUK also want to set up and Excess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry. During Covid people were given false information about the Covid vaccines and pressurised into taking the vaccine by the government and mainstream media. Eminent doctors who spoke out about the dangers of these vaccines were censored and were painted as ‘crazy anti-vaxers’ and accused of spreading conspiracy theories.\n\nThe information on the dangers of these vaccines and the real reason for them, were all out there but ordinary people who believed mainstream media, the government and the NHS and who only wanted to do what they thought was the ‘right thing’, did not have access to it. This should never be allowed to happen again.\n\nThis election is one of the most important elections our country has ever faced. We can vote for a party who wants to curtail our freedoms and impose a form of tyranny on us, or we can vote for a party who has common sense policies and wants to deal with the real issues facing the UK today.",

I then moved back to England for work three years ago and now live in Newton. My ancestors are from all over Britain - two of my great grandparents came from Hartford, Cheshire.\n\nAt university I studied mechanical engineering; I enjoyed the research-focused parts of the course the most, so I stayed on to do my doctorate too. I primarily studied metallurgy, and conducted research on the crystallographic phases of ferrous alloys for industrial engineering applications.\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy amateur photography (Pennington Flash - excellent) and play drums decently enough - for which I grew up playing heavy metal but also enjoy some jazz!\n\nI’ve always been interested in politics, and have been through the complete spectrum of political leanings, being more liberal in my teenage years but more right-leaning as I grew up (as is common to do so).\n\nI’m a firm believer in British sovereignty - I voted leave in 2016 and then supported the Brexit party in the European elections in 2019, before then voting for Boris for the first time in the 2019 General because I believed he would get Brexit over the line (ouch). Democracy is important to me - I believe that referenda are good things - let the people have a say!\n\nI joined Reform in 2023 after feeling betrayed by the Tories - Brexit in name only, mass immigration, highest taxes ever, mass invasion of illegals coming across the channel, and an NHS that has ground to a halt. I chose to stand in the Leigh & Atherton constituency because it’s on my doorstep and has been tremendously let down by successive Tory and Labour governments, with a perpetual Labour-controlled council that takes its voters for granted (good in-roads being made by independent candidates!).\n\nGreen space is incredibly important to me - probably as a result of growing up in rural Scotland. I’m an old-school environmentalist - let’s look after our forests, lakes, rivers, open green land - instead of concreting over them to build endless housing estates. The Leigh & Atherton constituency (including Lowton, Golborne, and Tyldesley) is being massively over-developed, with new housing estates being built on every available inch of land - reducing the quality of life for all residents in the constituency.\n\nSchool places are full, traffic at a standstill, a huge lack of social housing - and despite all of these people moving to the area - an incredibly run-down high street in Leigh. Something is clearly not working. The primary driver of this over-development is mass immigration - which drives down wages, drives up house prices, and dissolves our British culture. Does Leigh really need so many empty cash-only barber shops?\n\nTraditional red-wall voters have been betrayed by the Labour party, and betrayed by the Tories, many of whom kindly lent their vote to for the first time in 2019 to get Brexit done (myself included). Now where do we go? A Labour party that can’t say what a woman is? A Tory party with the highest levels of taxation ever?\n\nLeigh, Atherton, Lowton, Golborne, and Tyldesley need Reform. We are serious about changing politics for good\n\nOn July 4th, vote for Britain, vote for Reform, vote for George Woodward.\n\nDo you want your country back?",

I have also helped carers prepare for new careers working with young adults with autism, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to support this important community.\n\nHospitality: My experience in the hospitality sector has equipped me with exceptional customer service skills and the ability to manage and lead teams effectively.\n\nTransportation: Being a Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) driver has allowed me to see first-hand how drivers are penalized over the smallest things. I fully understand why we have had a massive problem bringing new people into the industry, leading to increased costs for consumers.\n\nMilitary Service: My proud service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) has honed my leadership abilities and commitment to excellence. The discipline and strategic thinking acquired during my time in the RAF are invaluable assets I bring to any role. Helping our service and ex-service men and women is one of the most important things to me. It’s time our heroes are not left behind anymore.\n\nAdditionally, I have run my own business, as a non-profit organization. This venture has helped children from all walks of life have the party of their dreams. It is well-known for its extensive charity work, supporting fundraisers, schools, and numerous individuals throughout the community.\n\nCommunity Involvement and Advocacy\n\nAs a passionate advocate for community empowerment and inclusivity, I have actively participated in various initiatives aimed at creating a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. As a dedicated father to a child with cerebral palsy, I've learned first-hand the importance of creating a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. My experiences have shaped my commitment to making a positive impact in the world around me.\n\nLocal Roots\n\nI was born in Mansfield Kings Mill Hospital and grew up in Blidworth, attending Joseph Whitaker School before joining the RAF at 19. Mansfield has always been my home, and my deep-seated connection to this town drives my commitment to its future.\n\nVision for Mansfield\n\nToday marks a significant milestone in my journey as I step forward to represent the people of Mansfield with renewed vigour and dedication. For years, I have dedicated myself to serving our community, striving to uphold the values and principles that make our town a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.\n\nA Call for Change\n\nUnder the Labour-led council and the Tory government over the past eight years, we have witnessed our great town become a shadow of its former self. Do we want to wait another four years to see it worsen under the same old parties and their \"more of the same\" policies? Or is it time for the great people of Mansfield to stand up and say, \"No more\"?\n\nIt's time for the working man to take a stand. No more career politicians lining their own pockets at the expense of the people of Mansfield. We deserve better, and together, we can achieve it.\n\nJoin me in this journey to restore Mansfield to its former glory. Together, we can bring about the change we need.\n\nThank you for your support.",

I stood for UKIP in NW Leicestershire – gaining 17%\n\n2016 Loughborough’s principal BREXIT campaigner, working cross party and none.\n\n2017 General Election. I stood for UKIP in Loughborough as a democracy candidate\n\n2018 Joined The Brexit Party. Campaigned hard until December 2019\n\n2021 Joined Reform UK as East & West Midlands area manager\n\n2022 County Organiser - Leicestershire & Rutland\n\n2024 PPC for Loughborough constituency and fighting hard.\n\nWhat’s good for the UK is good for Loughborough. I seek:\n\nA complete BREXIT with all the UK completely under UK law.\n\nNet Zero immigration, “one in, one out”, for essential skills that we can’t readily train.\n\n‘The small boat complements returned immediately to France’. Place all ‘illegals’ offshore and remove them promptly. They rejected the legal route and are always free to leave. A strict legal immigration system.\n\nAn Energy policy that supports UK industry and not that of China, India and others.\n\nAs is stands, Net Zero Energy is ‘Net Stupid’.\n\n The end of multiculturalism. Fortunately most cultures increasingly blend into our community based on English values, laws and language. Every culture matters, but primarily we’re all English. None of us need increasing division.\n\nStop paying people to do nothing. This needs serious debate.\n\nHousing in Loughborough is a nightmare.\n\nIt’s NOT a Housing Crisis. It’s a Population Crisis!",

I moved on to senior management positions within aviation related organisations based in the Middle East before becoming self-employed as an aviation safety consultant based in Bahrain.  During this time, I gained a PG Diploma in Training and Development and an MSc in Human Resource Development and Performance Management from the University of Leicester.\n\nI have worked extensively throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia which has given me a unique insight into the different approaches to governance in various cultures. In 2017 I was recognised as a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society due to my contributions to global aviation safety. This experience, in a highly regulated industry, has given me the skills needed when challenged by red tape bureaucracy. Contributing to public safety across a range of cultures has required tact and diplomacy and high levels of integrity. These are attributes that I endeavour to apply to everything that I do.\n\nIn 2019 I returned to the UK to be closer to my family but because of extraordinarily high house prices I decided to live on a narrowboat. I have been moored in Barton Marina ever since however I can often be found moored in Alrewas and Fradley enjoying nature as well as visiting local canal side hostelries.\n\nDuring the covid pandemic my small business was not able to trade fully and I found it a struggle to make ends meet. Because of this, I know how difficult our day to day life can be especially during the cost of living crisis. The current political situation has resulted in many of us living on the edge like this every day but it shouldn’t have to be this way.\n\nIt seems that the main political parties have moved away from that which they traditionally stand for, especially the Conservative Party. By aiming to please everyone it is obvious they are pleasing no one. This has given me the motivation and desire to give my time to the people of the Lichfield constituency in the hope that we can work together in improving our quality of life and ensuring a more positive future.\n\nIf you would like to support me and get involved, or simply want to share your opinions on how Reform UK could help you, please contact me by email or through the Reform UK – Lichfield Facebook Page.",

        "statement_to_voters": "My name is Sean Matthews, I am honoured and privileged to have been selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate in Louth and Horncastle for ReformUK. Who am I?\n\nI joined the Metropolitan Police in 1993 working in various boroughs and specialist departments, giving me a deep and broad understanding of the communities I worked in. I trained as a family liaison officer dealing with bereaved families, a very difficult job, but one that molded me into someone who loves life and believes we should care much more for one another, and that we should concentrate on the here and now much more than on what has or will happen.\n\nI retired from the Police in 2018 and we moved to Lincolnshire to live close to my eldest daughter. Choosing a farm just outside Horncastle, mainly because of the large field my younger children could run about in!\n\nI have four children, my eldest lives in Lincoln and is about to give birth to my third grandchild. A son who until recently lived with us at the farm, and two younger children. One attends a school in Horncastle and one who went to another Horncastle school, since winning a sports scholarship at a school in Lincoln.\n\nSince my retirement I became very involved in local politics, standing for election at both district and county elections, I ran elections campaigns for candidates at the last county election. I am very involved with the community, having been chairman of our local Parish meeting until last year. I am a huge rugby fan, my son plays for Lincoln RFC. We attend as many Leicester Tigers games as we can, and I try to play golf.\n\nI coached both of my sons in rugby and still hold an RFU coaching qualification. I am currently studying a master’s degree in politics, philosophy and economics at the open university, and I am loving getting back into education. Why Reform UK why Louth and Horncastle and why now?\n\nI was very involved in the local Conservative party; I was chair of one of the branches and I was on the executive of the association. But the Conservative party were moving ever further towards a left-wing agenda that now makes them indistinguishable from Tony Blairs Labour government. Ultimately, the absolute nonsense that the Conservatives have put us through over the last few years by getting rid of PM after PM and finally forcing one upon the nation that no one voted for did it for me.\n\nThe day they elected Sunak I resigned and joined Reform UK, as many others did. It was one of the busiest days for Refom UK’s new members team! It proved a very comfortable fit and I decided that I wanted to do more than ever before and stand for Reform UK at the next election. Although I have a gargantuan task of overturning a 26,000 majority, I will work my hardest to become the next MP for Louth and Horncastle.\n\nReform UK policies make this task much easier, that and the two woeful socialist parties. The Consocialists who have broken Britain and Labour who will bankrupt Britain.\n\nOur low tax, net zero Immigration, cheap energy and zero waiting lists policies make Reform UK the only real alternative choice.\n\nWe are the only party who WILL stop illegal immigration, we will reform the public sector, we will scrap the nonsensical net zero policies and we will deal with institutions like the BBC and the out of touch House of Lords.\n\nIt’s time to shake up the two-party election stalemate, they have completely let us down. This can and has happened before, there was no Labour party 125 years ago. I hope I will get your support at the next election; I hope this country take the bold but necessary step to elect someone new, both here in Louth and Horncastle and Nationally. So, let’s make Britain Great, it’s time to reform the UK, it’s time for Reform UK.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Malcolm is a genuinely local man. He grew up in Melksham and went to school at Aloeric Primary School and George Ward Comprehensive before emigrating to South Africa with his family when he was 15 years old in 1983.\n\nHe returned to this country in 1989 and became Editor of the Melksham News and founder Editor of White Horse News in 1990. He moved into public relations in 1992 and his career then took him away to London. In 1996 Malcolm was head hunted by the world’s biggest PR company as a Senior Consultant and moved to the Middle East. He returned to the UK in 2000 and moved to the world’s second largest PR company before becoming an independent consultant in 2003.\n\nMalcolm has travelled very widely with his career, spending extended periods of time in various parts of Africa, the Middle East and the Far East.\n\nMalcolm moved back to this area in 2019 and lives in Keevil with his wife Caroline, two dogs and a cat. \n\n“The truth is that I never wanted to leave in the first place. It was very difficult to leave my friends and home behind at the age of 15 and move to Apartheid era South Africa. For all of the years I spent in other parts of the world and chasing my career, I always had a strong sense that I was living in somebody else’s country or somebody else’s city and that as a guest I wasn’t entitled to express any opinion other than a gracious acknowledgement of the things that I benefited from in a foreign place.\n\n“Wherever I went I always made certain to learn as much as possible about the local language, history and culture, and in doing this have been acutely aware of my own need to have my own sense of belonging, to be at home and to treasure my own culture and history. \n\n“As a child I used to love cycling the lanes around Melksham, walking in the bluebell woods at Erlestoke or on Roundway Down and wherever I have been in the world, I genuinely dreamt about being able to do those things. So, it was quite literally a dream come true to finally come home and it has been fantastic to meet old friends again and finally have that sense of belonging. I never want to live anywhere else again.”\n\nMalcolm was an active member of the Conservative Party for 25 years before resigning last year. “The farce over the leadership contest was absolutely the final straw for me. The Conservative Party has moved further and further away from core conservative values in the last 20 years and I no longer felt able to support it. It is absolutely clear to me that those values have been embraced by Reform UK.\n\nThe Party stands strongly for the classically liberal values of low taxation, personal responsibility, small government, empowered individualism, properly policed borders, free market economics, law and order and, above all, common sense. It is resistant to conformity, statism, bureaucracy and authoritarianism. \n\n“This is a tumultuous time in politics, nationally and internationally and we need to see an end to the homogenous globalist social democrat-style me-too politics that have increasingly dominated our political system in recent years.\n\nSocially and economically the two party first-past-the-post system has failed the nation, leaving vast swathes of people politically homeless and watching powerless, locally and nationally, as policies are foisted on them with little or no democratic accountability. If you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got. It is time for people to have a real alternative that will enable their voices to be heard. A move away from the status quo. Reform UK provides that.”\n\nMalcolm has strong views on the need for true local representation in national politics. \n\n“National problems are local problems. People everywhere are concerned about the economy, about energy supply and cost, about their freedom to travel, about illegal immigration, about culture wars, crime and housing. Some of these issues are more prominent in this area than others though and there are also specific concerns here that can only be addressed if they are taken to Parliament and fought for with passion by somebody who understands them and who is genuinely part of the local community and willing to fight for it.\n\nThe MP should be listening to local people and working for them. You are elected to serve, not elected to rule. Starting right now I will be going to every Parish Council in the constituency and finding out what local residents genuinely need and aspire to so that I can fight for them if I am elected. That’s what every MP should do. Use their ears for their constituents and their mouths in Parliament, not the other way around.\n\n“One of the biggest problems we have in politics now is that Parliament is chocked full of identikit career politicians who get parachuted into constituencies that they have no real affiliation to, having previously gone to the ‘right’ school and Oxbridge. They often have no real-life experience. They exist to impose centralised policies on their constituents, regardless of their opinions, needs and aspirations. I’ve done things the hard way. I haven’t been parachuted in from London or Cheshire with the financial support of a big political party.\n\nI grew up in Melksham, I went to a Comprehensive school, I didn’t get to go to university because I had to go out and work. I’ve uprooted myself time and again to chase opportunity and I have had to work hard for everything I have. I’ve been very lucky, I know many people who have just as much to offer as me and more, who haven’t had the opportunities I have had. I think everybody deserves opportunity, regardless of where they went to school or how much money their parents had. If you are talented and hardworking you should be able to have the opportunity to fulfil your potential and your background should be irrelevant. \n\n“Reform UK has now given me the greatest opportunity I have ever had, to fight to represent all the people in the area I come from and belong in. I will do everything I can to do that as well as it can possibly be done.”\n\nOutside politics Malcolm enjoys walking in the countryside with his dogs, restoring and showing classic cars and motorcycles. He is an avid supporter of Bath Rugby and Somerset cricket and has a deep interest in British history.",

He is also a director of a charity that assists disabled people, veterans and able-bodied.\n\nGareth was a Liberal Democrat member 20 years ago but lost faith in them in 2010 after they negotiated with the Conservatives due to a hung parliament. In 2016 he voted to leave the European Union and voted for the Conservatives in the 2019 election. However, since the withdrawal from the EU in 2020 Gareth knows the Conservative Party have let down the UK. Gareth believes the only way to make Britain great again was to join the Reform Party and run as a candidate for the Merthyr and Aberdare constituency. He knows the only way to make change is by getting elected to Government so that he can contribute from within Westminster.\n\nGareth urges his constituents to vote for Reform UK especially if you vote for any party but Labour. He states we must have a party that can be a strong opposition to a Labour Government and ensure that NHS waiting lists are brought down, homelessness is corrected, mental health becomes a priority for the young and old, energy bills are made affordable, more police on our streets, families below the poverty line are given more help, make the military strong again and provide veterans with all the help they need. \n\nA vote for me is a vote for real change and helps the Reform Party maintain a strong foothold in British politics.",

And after returning to Britain I was elected as a Conservative Councillor for Frinton and Walton Town Council 2017 and 2019.\n\nTo quote the [local paper] Clacton Gazette I polled almost more votes than my four election rivals combined and I romped home to win. \n\nLike many people I became disillusioned, disappointed and felt very let down by the Conservative Party who continually make promises and are constantly inconsistent in their decisions.\n\nI joined Reform UK because I believe that they will be consistent in their decisions and I am thrilled and excited to be selected as P.P.C. for Maldon Constituency.\n\nReform UK have given me and provided Britain with hope that we can all again be proud of being British.  A country where we can be safe in our own homes and on the streets no matter who we are or where we come from.\n\nI will be honoured to represent the constituents of the Maldon area, always being available to deal with any worries, concerns or issues they may have and I am not afraid of speaking up for truth and justice.    \n\nWe all know that Immigration must be tightly controlled for the sake of each and everyone of us. Those coming in illegally have been allowed and even welcomed by many in power and certain charities and it seems they have priority over all of us. I fully support Reform UK’s  policy of bringing this to a halt.\n\nLikewise we have a wonderful health service which is constantly being stretched to the limit as are all the medical staff by the extra demands put upon it by mass immigration into this country.  Again something Reform UK and I are dedicated to change.\n\nOther areas I am passionate about is the care of vulnerable adults and children who are either mentally or physically abused by family members due to family break ups or those outside the family.  And we must not forget our Services, the men and women who during conflict often make the ultimate sacrifice with their lives in the name of serving the United Kingdom and keeping us all safe.\n\nOnly Reform UK is dedicated enough to bring about real change to our broken and increasingly fractured society and if you vote for Reform UK Pamela Walford PPC for Maldon you can rely on me to see these changes brought about.\n\nBy voting for Reform UK you will be putting the ‘Great’ back into Great Britain.  \n\nSo, Let’s Make Great Britain Great Again!",

Our dependence on foreign energy has persistently drawn us into conflict in the middle east. High energy costs in this country have driven manufacturing out, and they have forced millions of people to choose between heating and eating.\n\nWaiting lists in the NHS have risen to record levels despite record levels of funding, due to mismanagement of services and policy.\n\nWe are now more dependent on foreign imports than any time in our history, making us highly vulnerable in the event of a future global conflict.\n\nOur countryside in Mid-Norfolk is being neglected and mismanaged with underspending on infrastructure, causing flooding, traffic and waiting lists.\n\nWe are running war time levels of debt in a peace time economy and it is only going to get worse.\n\nHowever, it is not too late to turn things around. The policies of Reform UK are specifically targeted at saving this country from the downward spiral that awaits us with the Westminster Blob of Conservative and Labour policies.\n\nWe can completely transform the way politics works in the UK, with a new electoral system where every vote counts, a British constitution that protects our rights, including the right to free speech, and a new revising chamber that is accountable to the people, not stuffed full of party donors.",

        "name": "Tom Smith",
        "statement_to_voters": "Please allow me to introduce myself as your Reform UK candidate. I’m Thomas Patrick Smith, aka “Tom Smith”. I was born in Shropshire but moved with my family to Leicestershire as a young child.  I grew up in the Leicestershire Charnwood area and always appreciated the beauty of the forest and surrounding area, which I used to observe travelling to school on the bus from Woodhouse Eaves to Hind Leys and Rawlins upper schools.\n\nI first got into politics when I began work as a pharmacy porter at the Leicester Royal Infirmary in 1979 aged sixteen. At this time there were many strikes and disputes prevailing. At the age 17, I became a union rep. This helped me understand not only about politics and why all these disputes were going on, but it also gave me the opportunity to represent people and help them in disciplinaries and mediation. \n\nStaying in the NHS, I did my nurse’s training at De Montfort University. In 1999 I was elected as a cohort rep, and worked as a charge nurse. Thereafter I was a senior prison nurse within the NHS, for 22 years. \n\nThere are lots of reasons why I want to see Reform UK succeed in the general election. I’ll highlight them as concisely as I can.  For years, I have seen the NHS run down by misguided and single-minded management who think that pouring more money in and creating more managers will solve its endless problems.  We need locally trained people in all areas of government employment, one being the NHS itself. We must support younger people, encouraging them to address school students to utilise more apprenticeships.  There are many issues that Reform UK aims to rectify. The Reform UK ‘Our Contract with You’ highlights these; take a look.  https://www.reformparty.uk/policies\n\nOn a more local level, I am standing in Mid Leicestershire - formerly Charnwood - constituency.  This is the area I grew up in.  On a personal note, I want to help the people of Leicestershire formally preserve and enjoy their environment and its rich heritage. Ever more uncontrolled immigration results in more housing, more housing costs, less land for farming, worse public services and fewer jobs for the local people. \n\nThen there is the Net Zero issue that tells people what transport they should use.  Try getting from home to work in the middle of winter in an electric car and not being able to charge it due to no charging points or being stuck in the city traffic as your battery runs out.\n\nThese things should have been properly considered by the current government. We also would like to support the farmers and keep the land for farming, not wind or solar farms which have added to your utility bills before they have even been installed.  I have a passion to make Britain Great, keep Mid Leicestershire (Charnwood) constituency Great, and to free Britain from all EU imposed restrictions. Reform UK and our Mid Leicestershire team will not back down. The outgoing government and the UK opposition are one and the same. They have and would continue to let us down.\n\nI feel it’s time for a Change to a positive future.  Reform UK can bring that Change.  Be part of that Change and vote for Reform UK; a local candidate with the people of Mid Leicestershire at heart.\n\nI would like to mention my Mid Leicestershire election team.  Without them, and people like them, Reform UK would not be so effective. Please lend them your support.  “THANK YOU, team Mid Leicestershire”. Also, a huge thanks to all Reform UK supporters.  I extend this invitation to you all, the voters of Mid Leicestershire.\n\nCome and join us and “LET’S MAKE BRITAIN GREAT”.\n\nIf you want change, you need to vote for it.",

From Hodge Lea to Oldbrook and now presently residing in Woburn Sands, I’m just down the road from my small business within the constituency. A Private Gym – The POD ‘The Pain of Discipline’ - perfectly surmises my attitude and work ethic. \n\nWhether that was as an operational Prison Officer for 4 years at HMP Woodhill (Milton Keynes’ very own Category A High-Security Prison, of which two years were on the CSC Unit - check it out) or founding my own small business a few years ago, discipline, accountability and social responsibility has underpinned it all. To complete the Jim Rohn quote, thus avoiding ‘The Pain of Regret’.\n\nWith many personal opportunities on the horizon, including a lead role in a feature film next year as well as the growth of my business, standing for Reform UK is perhaps an inconvenience. Truthfully it is. Much like my previous political engagements, particularly in 2016, aiding the ‘Leave’ campaign with logistics, public speaking and debates, my disposition has always been based solely on conviction and principle. \n\nIn 2019, I supported Nigel Farage’s narrative in the General Election to not disrupt the Tories, despite growing doubt in the Conservatives. I too believed Boris Johnson could unite the right-of-centre, fulfil Brexit and move us to a completely sovereign, liberal economy (low tax / high growth / higher revenue) underpinned with social conservatism. Evidently, that did not transpire and the trend line stooped downward even more. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. \n\nSo, this time I will be standing for the only right-of-centre party in the election, that actually believes and manifests a patriotic libertarian attitude. \n\nLabour will inevitably let down the blue-collar workers (especially in the North) to prioritise the ‘Woke’, Metropolitan and Muslim pull factors (how they reconcile those groups, I don’t know). As for the Conservatives, they have already let down their core voters. 14 years of potential wasted as if in an Orwellian memory hole. They are closing their term with self-destruction, exploitation of trust and lost integrity. The Tories have failed by even their own standards, let alone any other metric, most notably:\n\n-\tNational Debt -\tDelivering Brexit -\tImmigration\n\nI genuinely believe the Reform Party presents a viable, attractive and positive manifesto (definitely check it out) that can emulate Canadian politics in the 80s with their own Reform Party. Should I overcome first-past-the-post and become your MP, I would like to make “absolutely clear” that my present business ambitions will halt; I will drop all tools and utilise the attributes mentioned in my opening paragraphs to ensure you are represented, authentically and sincerely via Reform UK.",

I started working at the height of the Blair reform era, where I like many others witnessed the shift of monetary power away from the people to large corporations. Supermarkets were able to monopolise and kill off many town centres.\n\nThen there were new wars which brought much misery and devastation to the world. And constitutional reforms that continually shifted power away from the people to financial corporate bodies. I believe many of the nation's problems can be attributed to self-interest and profiteering, an example being the human trafficking in the channel, which would end if Serco were nationalised.\n\nBlairism, which is ongoing, consolidated power in the hands of wealthy corporate private members clubs and cynically uses well-meaning people on the left of politics to create policy which is then enacted by one of the two ruling parties. The policies of the Conservative party often seem to have origins in Labour party ideas.        \n\nI was honoured to be selected for the seat of Mid Derbyshire for Reform UK and help a movement determined to make things right.

Since being appointed to Mid Bedfordshire in early 2022 I first introduced himself to residents delivering 60,000 leaflets, speaking to many people along the way.\n\nDuring the Mid Beds by-election campaign which extended to 132 consecutive days of campaigning I, along with a fantastic team knocked on 40,000 doors as well as holding local events with high profile Reform UK speakers in attendance.\n\nI'm committed to getting the Parties policies out across the whole Mid Bedfordshire constituency (which for the 2024 general election will have a newly defined boundary reducing the electorate to 71,748).\n\nI have been involved with several local campaigns including fighting to prevent the creation of Greenwoods New Town between Barton-le-Clay and Silsoe as well as assisting the campaign for a GP surgery in Wixams.\n\nMid Bedfordshire has seen the third largest growth in new homes in the country with no addition to any of our services for the residents. No new GP's or surgeries, no more dentists, no more school places, no more police, no infrastructure spending of any note at all. This has resulted in all our standards of living progressively falling as we have to queue for appointments, for operations and struggle to find a dentist.\n\nMid Bedfordshire does not have a single bank branch, not one. If you want to visit a bank you have to travel to Bedford, Luton or Hitchin.\n\nOur council, Central Bedfordshire Council has pledged to double it's debt to £850 million by 2026 in order to fund its pet construction project, New Vista Homes, a building company that it believes will pay off the debts it has run up through mismanagement.\n\nOther councils who have tried similar ventures such as Croydon, Thurrock & Woking have all gone bust doing so. I believe that the council should stick to delivering services, in house, saving money instead of contracting services out to profit making enterprises.\n\nThe residents of Mid Bedfordshire deserve better, they deserve to get better value for their taxes. Many of these local issues are driven by national policy, mass immigration and the cost of our obsessive net zero at all cost ideology.\n\nI'm standing for Reform UK because I have had enough of the mediocre representation we have received over the last few decades that has led us to where we are today.\n\nIf you are fed up too, get involved, join us, volunteer and help us campaign.",

        "statement_to_voters": "My name is Stefan Garbowski. I was born in Poland and moved to Edinburgh in 2005 to work as a joiner and to create a better life for my family. Later I moved to Midlothian and whilst living here with my new wife, I become a British citizen.\n\nAs time has gone by I have observed the decline of the British way of life and values. Everything seems to be broken. We have record numbers using food banks, the longest NHS waiting list, our Civil Service has apparently never returned to the office but are still working from home, and worst of all we have suffered restrictions of freedoms enforced on society…speech, choice ie, No jab = no job, Stay at Home, LEZ areas. The list goes on.\n\nI have become increasingly concerned about the pressure of illegal immigrants on our housing, jobs, NHS and other services whilst British people are being put at the back of the queue. I fully support the Reform UK policy of freezing non-essential migration and of stopping the boats, leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and zero illegal immigrants being resettled in the UK.\n\nI am also extremely concerned about indoctrination of school children and the constant sexualisation of them. School should be a place of learning with a focus on knowledge, skills and values not ideology and therefore I would support the banning of transgender ideology and critical race theory in Primary and Secondary schools.\n\nBritish values, including freedom of speech are being lost. I would like to see a return to personal liberty and free speech for all. I feel that Reform UK Scotland is the only party that will stand up for British values, British people and the British way of life – tolerance, equality before the law, free speech and most important of all common sense.",

        "statement_to_voters": "I am David McNabb, the Reform Party candidate for the Mid Dunbartonshire seat in Westminster. I firmly believe that hard work should enable anyone to achieve their goals, no matter their background, education, or skill levels.\n\nI am committed to fostering prosperity in all of the towns and rural communities across Mid Dunbartonshire by focusing on growing our local economy and developing sustainable jobs through effective transport links and direct investment. Aligned with the Reform Party’s vision, I am dedicated to moving beyond the divisive politics that have fragmented our communities, advocating for a united approach to meet the immediate needs of our people in Scotland and Mid Dunbartonshire.\n\nMy key message is straightforward: regardless of your education, background, religion or beliefs, I aim to make your life more secure and better by minimising government intervention. Together, we can build a community where everyone is empowered to raise their families in safety with confidence and pride.\n\nPersonal Background:\n\nBorn in Yoker and raised by a single parent, I learned the importance of balancing hard work with family commitments from a young age. Experiencing the pressures of making ends meet, I came to understand first-hand the challenges many families face — from affording school uniforms and Christmas presents to enjoying simple holidays. These experiences instilled in me a deep understanding of the struggles faced by underprivileged families.\n\nMy educational journey led me from Primary and Secondary School, where juggling part-time work with studies made academic pursuits challenging. Determined to succeed, I chose a pragmatic route to higher education through local colleges, focusing on IT before ultimately graduating from Glasgow University with an Honours Degree in Computing Science.\n\nProfessionally, I have enjoyed a successful career in IT and digital transformations, contributing across sectors including the energy sector and public sector as banking and financial services. My work across these diverse fields has provided me with a broad perspective on the economic, public and energy challenges facing Scotland today.\n\nAs a single parent of four boys, I live the work-life balance struggle many families endure. My life, bustling with the activities of a dynamic family, gives me a unique insight into the realities of modern family life, from supporting my boys’ football ambitions to ensuring they can pursue their own dreams and interests. This personal experience drives my commitment to serve and improve our community, advocating for policies that support families of all configurations and faiths in achieving a balanced and fulfilling life.\n\nMy personal interests mirror my love for the outdoors and an active lifestyle. An avid hill walker, golfer, and motorbike enthusiast, I find solace and adventure in Scotland’s landscapes. Having completed a marathon and currently training for the Edinburgh Marathon, I embody the determination and discipline I hope to bring to my political career. These pursuits keep me grounded and connect me to our community and the beautiful environment of Mid Dunbartonshire.\n\nMy journey from a youth in Yoker to a Reform Party candidate is a testament to my belief in hard work, resilience, and the power of community. I stand ready to bring my blend of professional expertise and personal empathy to serve the people of Mid Dunbartonshire, working tirelessly to create a brighter future for all.",

        "name": "Gary Peter Johnson",
        "statement_to_voters": "I have lived in the Uckfield area and been married, for 30 years. We have two ‘grown up’ children that have both flown the nest and we have a granddaughter. We have three Scottish Terriers that tend to ignore anything that I say and I have been trying unsuccessfully to learn to play the guitar for fifty years.\n\nI am state educated and had no idea what a university was when I was eighteen.\n\nFor the last thirteen years, together with my wife, we owned and ran a successful care business in Sussex. \n\nFrom 2019 – 2023, I served as a Conservative District Councillor (Wealden).\n\nI have always enjoyed volunteering. Many years ago, I was an army reservist. I spent 6 years as part of the RNLI as a crew member on the Newhaven Lifeboat and have also been a Special Constable based at Haywards Heath.\n\nWhy am I standing for election and why for the Reform Party?\n\nI am certainly not a career politician but over the last couple of years, I have realised that I no longer have synergy with any of the major political parties in the UK. Effectively, there seems to be too much politics in politics. We have a short-term political system whereby political parties don't have the courage to make the radical changes that this country needs if we are to progress. We need radical change and need to be brave to make those changes. We are a great nation but we need to drive forward. Proportional representation and more cross party working to utilise all talent in British politics would be a good start.\n\nBusiness\n\nRunning a business is tough. Making decisions that affect hundreds of people whilst continuing to keep your business viable is not easy. I believe that SMEs play a huge part in driving the economy whilst providing jobs to many people. Reform will reduce the amount of Corporation Tax paid by businesses and increase the income tax threshold to encourage people off benefits and back to work.\n\nNHS\n\nI support the NHS. My daughter was born in the Princess Royal Hospital and spent two weeks in the special care unit so we are eternally grateful for all the support given at that time. Unfortunately, much has changed over the years and our NHS is now in crisis. There is no point in ploughing more money into a system that isn't working before significant changes are made. Reform has clearly set out how those changes can be made to give the NHS a second life.\n\nPolice\n\nI have had the pleasure of working with Sussex Police as a special constable and understand the challenges and frustrations felt by many police officers. County drug lines, rural crime, antisocial behaviour and shop lifting are all on the increase in the local area. We do need more police officers, but we also need to streamline processes and procedures, so officers spend less time in the station and more time on patrol. This is what most officers would far rather be doing. Zero tolerance policing and increased stop and search powers will reduce antisocial behaviour and knife crime. We need significantly more detention places so more custodial sentences become the norm and reduced prison sentences due to capacity issues are irradicated. The Reform Party has set out how it will give the police more powers as well as 40,000 additional police officers in the next five years.\n\nFamily\n\nNot everything is the fault of the government or the responsibility of schools.\n\nI am a big believer in the family unit (traditional or otherwise).\n\nReform has set out how it will support families via tax incentives and changes to child benefits.\n\nHousing Crisis\n\nAs a district councillor, I spent many years on planning committees and became extremely frustrated with the planning system. The current system demands planning applications for thousands of houses to be passed in the hope that 35% will be affordable to first time buyers or purchased by housing associations. It simply isn't working. We have been left with planning permissions being granted but then being sold on rather than being built out. Those that are built out in reasonable time tend to lack infrastructure. The housing crisis needs defining and then a joined-up approach needs to be formulated. Reform is committed to reviewing the planning system.\n\nDefence\n\nI believe in our commitment to NATO and Trident. As an ex-reservist, I recognise that our army has some of the best trained soldiers in the world, but we are far from the best equipped. Reform is committed to an increase in Defence spending and maintaining a lead role in NATO.\n\nImmigration\n\nAs an ex-lifeboat crew member, I have every sympathy for those in danger at sea but we cannot continue to allow the small boats to cross the channel.\n\nSmashing the gangs will not work. The gangs are only providing a service.\n\nUltimately, we should detain, process and deport illegal immigrants swiftly which will deter and greatly reduce the numbers attempting the crossing.\n\nWe also need to work smarter with our European partners to try and stop immigration Europe wide.\n\nReform has set out its 6-point plan to stop the boats.\n\nOur Contract With You - Reform UK (reformparty.uk)\n\nI will be standing at the next General Election and if successful, I intend to be a strong voice that represents the people of Mid Sussex. If unsuccessful, I will be buying a sailing boat and taking guitar lessons.\n\nI will be delighted to hear from you and will welcome any thoughts, comments or frustrations.\n\nThank you",

        "statement_to_voters": "First and foremost, I'm not in politics to benefit myself. I'm in it to represent the people, the people of my community, in this case Neath and Swansea East. \n\nMy history..............Dai Richards is Neath born, educated in Port Talbot (Tirmorfa, Blaen Baglan & Glanafan, always living in Neath, Port Talbot or Swansea. In 1891 all 4 sets of my great grandparents lived within a stone's throw of Neath Town Centre. These include William Henry Snow who at one time employed over 300 men in his Snow's building and construction company. My great great father Thomas Snow is credited with building Victoria Gardens in Neath. I have great pride in my family's contribution to the town of Neath but am saddened to see the town's demise through poor governance.\n\nAbout myself............I am best known for my contribution to sport in the area; representing Wales in 6 sports; cyclo cross, triathlon, mountain biking, mountain running, duathlon and marathon kayaking. In 2000 I won the world quadrathlon championship (swimming, cycling, running & kayaking) in the veteran's category and the following year was named the Neath Port Talbot Sports Personality of the Year. In 2009 Inside Welsh Sport Magazine awarded me the title Wales' Fittest Man.\n\nI have been a member of many clubs in the Neath & Swansea areas including Swansea & Neath Harriers, Swansea Wheelers, Swansea CC, Swansea Bay Orienteering Club, Neath and Swansea Leisure Centre squash clubs. I was awarded life membership of Celtic Tri, in recognition for my contribution to the sport of triathlon in the area. \n\nOur company Rugby Relics Ltd is the leading supplier of Rugby Memorabilia worldwide and I've written a book on the origin of Rugby Union, predominantly its a book about the governance of sport. My collection of rugby memorabilia is recognised as one of the finest in the world and I've exhibited part of it at the Gwyn Hall and Castle Hotel in Neath to celebrate the Welsh Rugby Union's 125th and 130th anniversaries.\n\nAs a member of the Territorial Army I served our nation with pride for nine years with the Royal Corps of Transport and Royal Regiment of Wales, both based in Swansea.\n\nYou will also probably have seen me on screen appearing in documentaries relating to rugby and working as an extra on film and TV, in productions such as Casualty, Sherlock, Wolf Hall, Decline and Fall and the locally filmed Pride. Acting is in the family, I am distantly related to the Wales' first Oscar winner, Ray Milland, the Neath born actor. \n\nMy politics..........In the political arena, I have for the last 8 years been fighting for the safety of a resident's group as the chairman of Glynneath Residents Against Contamination. During this time I have become an expert in the deliberate failure of government and government enforcement agencies to follow protocol. Government at all levels in the United Kingdom is out of control and we, the people need to 'nip this in the bud' before our rich heritage and culture reach a point of no return.\n\nMy family has been placed in danger because of corrupt governance and with corruption in UK government growing I believe the safety of all our families will be compromised at sometime in the near future. With this in mind, I have joined Reform UK, the only party with a clear vision to repair our nation, our Broken Britain.\n\nMy pedigree.............Having been successful in business for 46 years, active in sports governance and coaching for 45 years, served in the military for 9 years, having studied government systems and strategies for 8 years I believe that I have the ability to effect change for the good in our society. I still have the energy and the passion to work for the benefit of the communities of Neath and Swansea East.\n\nIn 6 years, as chairman of the Neath & Swansea based Multisport Racing Club, I built the club from 2 to 200 members to become the fastest and most successful club Wales had seen. Alongside of the club I created a feeder system for young athletes at the Neath Port Talbot College Triathlon Academy and at one time 75 per cent of age group champions in Wales were part of that system. \n\nOur problem..........There is not a lot of difference between the combative strategies used in sport, the military and governance. Our biggest problem is that the government don't follow the rules they set. They are also the referee and if the rules don't suit them, then they change them to suit themselves. Britain is Broken and Reform UK is all about rebuilding Britain, creating order from the disorder and the shambles in which we now find our country. Let us, you and I, do this together. \n\nOur future........I want us to work together for our collective futures, if its only a vote you can give, then that's fine, please help in any way you can. I am a family man and I have strived to do the best for my children. I grew up in a council estate, the son good working class parents with good morals, I have inherited those morals.\n\nI have 4 children, and they all have good jobs and all own their own homes, I know that doesn't sound much but in today's society our children are struggling to exist. Two of my children are published and respected scientists, and 3 out of the 4 have achieved international honours in sport with one, born in Swansea a world champion in the sport of White Water Rafting.\n\nOur legacy..........When my days are over, I want us to leave behind a better place for my 4 grand children and their children. If we can do this together, it means a better future for your children and your ancestors too. Please join with me, by voting for Reform and/or joining with me on the Reform team for a better Neath & Swansea East, a better Wales and a better Britain.\n\nLet's save Britain together.",

I was previously in the Conservatives, thinking they would look after the economy so that people could prosper, but the last 14 years has seen economic stagnation. So, I joined Reform UK.\n\nReform will abolish a Net Zero energy policy which currently traps 860,000 Scottish households in fuel poverty. But don’t worry as you suffer, you will be ‘saving the planet’. We will raise the point at which people pay tax to £20,000, freeing seven million of the least well off from income tax, putting money in their pockets to stimulate the economy, and making it worthwhile for about two million people to come off benefits and into work. They will go from being dependent on the state to financial independency and the self-esteem that brings.\n\nAbolishing Net Zero will save billions and we are the only party to expose the scandal of the banks charging us interest on the money that was printed to pay for us to stay at home during lockdown. Other countries haven’t done this, but Labour and the Tories seem unwilling to challenge the Bank of England. Stopping this would save us £35 billion to pay for tax cuts.\n\nImmigration the equivalent of the City of Glasgow every year places huge pressure on our housing stock and raises rents.

However, having observed the complete and unmitigated mess that our various elected representatives and political parties have made of our once beautiful United Kingdom, I felt that I could no longer just sit on the side lines and complain.\n\nAs a brief summary, here is where our country is in 2023:\n\nOut of control, illegal migration occurring in the tens of thousands annually which our Government seems unable or unwilling to do anything about. We, the taxpayers, are paying millions of pounds daily to house and sustain these alleged “refugees”. (France, the last point of origin for many claimants, is a safe country)\n\nA public healthcare system with a current backlog exceeding 7.4 million patients.\n\nStrikes in public sector rivalling those last seen in the 1970’s.\n\nOut of control inflation (with no plan from the Bank of England) that is making many citizens of the UK net poorer and unable in some cases to pay for essentials such as accommodation, food and energy.\n\nNet zero policies being forced on us that no one voted for. These net zero policies are trickle down policies originating from unelected, global organisations such as the United Nations and World Economic Forum. We are all paying for these “initiatives” via our income tax and via levies imposed as part of our utility bills. We are all certainly getting net poorer for benefits to our environment and world that are questionable at best and very likely economically damaging to current and future generations.\n\nThe highest taxation burden in 70 years combined with a progressive deterioration in the quality and availability of our vital public services.\n\nA general distrust in our political system following various scandals including expenses, “partygate”, inappropriate and sometime illegal activities and so on. Faith in our politicians is perhaps at an all time low.\n\nIt is for these reasons together with many more that I feel obliged to pay down my debt to this wonderful country and the opportunities and freedom that it has afforded me over many decades when we had a fairer, more equal society where basic human values such as respect, decency and moral integrity meant something.\n\nTherefore, I stand in North Cornwall - my home as your potential Parliamentary representative and voice for decency, honesty and truth.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Ash is an HGV driver by trade and has been in the transport industry for nearly 10 years, along with some agricultural contracting in his younger years. He has lived in the North Dorset area for most of his life and currently lives in Sturminster Newton. Several times he has left the area either for education or for work purposes abroad, including driving road trains in Australia. He feels that now is the time to enter the political sphere, unfortunately mostly due to anger.\n\nHe feels let down by 13 years of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility, followed by 14 years of absolute toxic Tory chaos and lies.... with nothing more than one big game of hot potato amongst its top brass in recent years to show for it!\n\nHow is it that any taxpayer can justify going to work to fund hotel rooms for people who have entered our country illegally? How has our country got 20 million people on the waiting list for our NHS? (Yes, its 20 million!) Not 7.7 million people as the Tories keep claiming! How have we allowed ourselves to fall into £2.5 trillion of national debt? Why has the economy been stagnant for the last 15 years? Why do we keep sending British taxpayers' money which we all have no say in to support foreign governments to fight other governments' proxy wars? Why is everyone being punished for having clean air?\n\nWhy do our elderly have to sell their house to fund social care? Where are the 40 new hospitals Britain was promised? Why is there so much rubbish on the sides of our roads? Why are our schools falling down onto our children from aerated concrete? Why are we not investing in our farmers to produce high yields of food production to stop importing expensive foreign food products? Why have we not invested in fibre optic broadband and other digital technologies?\n\nWhere is the online protection for children, families and young people against online harms? How can we bring communities together to share our sports, hobbies, clubs and societies? Why has Brexit not been done properly? Why do I need a visa to go on a slightly longer holiday or travel in Europe? Where is the incentive to invest in science, technology and engineering in our area? Why is Britain no longer ready to deploy its armed forces overnight abroad if it had to? What happened to helping our veterans who sleep rough at night having served for their country?\n\nWhere is the pride, discipline and respect amongst young people these days? What happened to national service? Why are we dumping sewage multiple times every day into our rivers and seas? Why does everyone's council tax keep rocketing? Why are our farmers not being valued 3 times a day and not being paid properly by the supermarkets?\n\nWhy are the pension systems not reformed to match those similar to European countries? Where have family values gone with lack of support for free childcare? Why is it impossible to freely trade and set up a new business without getting hammered for corporation tax and business rates? Where is the incentive to go and do an honest days' work? Why do young people have no hope of being able to afford their own home?\n\nWhy is the social housing waiting list currently sat at 1.6 million people? Why do people get stung with capital gains tax having worked hard their whole life for their cash and assets? Why do people not have spare cash or savings anymore? Why are we in a cost-of-living crisis? How can young people afford £9,250 per year to go to university?\n\nWhy have the roads not been re-surfaced with fresh tarmac? Why are people choosing over whether to heat their home or put hot food on the table? Why are my energy bills so expensive? Why are people relying on food banks? Where is the drive to upskill Britain and get more people trade qualified? Why are children being taught its acceptable to have a sex change under the age of 18?\n\nWhy do we have such social regional inequality across Britain? Why are transport links between our villages and towns so minimal? Where is the proper help that our vulnerable elderly and disabled so desperately need? Why has the education syllabus not been overhauled to teach our young essential life skills, e.g. cooking, driving, swimming, home economics etc.? Why have we not overhauled the welfare system with a simple 'Universal Basic Income' e.g. citizens wage?\n\nWhy do we not have proportional representation? Why do we not have multi-choice referendums allowing the people to decide what happens in our country, not our politicians? Why does it flood every year on cue everywhere in Britain? Where is the spirit to run a successful business and make money?\n\nWhy has Britain crumbled?\n\nIf you’re starting to get the gist of where I'm coming from with this and if you have had enough of all of the problems too, then perhaps now is the time to look at alternatives to the status quo when voting at this year’s general election....\n\nWe live in a democracy! We are free to think, act and speak freely meaning you don’t have to completely agree with everything that any one party is standing for, or for that case agree with anything that anyone says! I do have a vision myself of what the state should look like and how it should operate and be governed. I think we all do. So if you a bright idea and you feel very passionately about something, then make sure your voice is heard!\n\nIn a nutshell, we need to clear the debt. We need a new hospital building program. We need a new school building program. We need to scrap university and college tuition fees. We need to pay our medical staff properly and show them respect. We need to educate our young properly. We need to help people get their own house. We need energy security to bring prices down, perhaps with a new publicly owned nuclear energy company. We need food security to bring prices down and support our farmers. We need a road re-surfacing program and a motorist/trucking services re-building program, something I will personally absolutely fight for. We need a new pensions system, perhaps with private investment bonds with taxpayer money.\n\nWe need to stimulate the economy for decent public services with 15% corporation tax, scrapping business rates, all new businesses being  corporation tax free for the first 2 years, increase the personal tax free allowance from £12,570 to £20,000, change the PAYE tax bands perhaps from 20/40/45 to 15/30/45, move the goal posts for PAYE too putting more money in people's pocket, strip out as much unnecessary red tape as possible, perhaps cap council tax at £50/£100 per month and have a fiscal responsibility enquiry on a local level, bring back the £1,200 energy price cap, the possibility of food stamps for families, smash inflation to as close to 0% as possible helping ease the cost of living, interest rates, mortgages and people's real terms wages.\n\nNo immigration = no economy. Too much immigration = pressure on public services, housing and infrastructure. A sensible, legal and safe 1-in 1-out approach to migration policy will help get the economy up and running and keep the population at a fairly sensible level. A strong hard working upskilled productive workforce is what Britain needs! A strong economy needs certain levers to be pulled and it’s not an overnight thing! It takes time to build a healthy strong economy! And after a hard long weeks' work, what’s wrong with a beer and a smoke on your weekend off? I have no problem with it, but that's just my own personal opinion. Maybe we may need legislation for that too!\n\nWhatever we need, we need change.... and we need it now! So, make sure you vote for it! Put on your British redcoat and have some pride! See you all in battle at the general election! Thank you and God bless the Westcountry!\n\nVote Reform UK!",

        "statement_to_voters": "My name is Andy Dye and I am your Reform Party candidate for North Herefordshire in the forthcoming General Election.\n\nI come from a military, engineering and farming family background. I myself am a former Paratrooper. I am fiercely and unapologetically proud of my country, its history, its culture and its achievements.\n\nI spent 10 years in the Army before my wife and I went to live in Australia for several years returning home in 2013 We have owned and operated an air conditioning company, a window manufacturing business and also renovated several properties.\n\nI have taken on this role with Reform as our national priorities are all wrong and the true interests of the British people clearly do not matter at all to our political class.\n\nThese coddled, self-styled “urban elites” indulge their fantasies and luxury beliefs certain of their superiority- the rest of us look on horrified and amazed at their naive stupidity and arrogant entitlement.\n\nPeople who have never done a hard day’s work like to talk about what they want to do to you when they “get into power”.\n\nI have never done anything but work hard and I do not seek power over others. I wish to serve my constituents, get government out of their way and help facilitate their entrepreneurial spirit. This is how democracy is supposed to work. \n\nThe current rule by cosy Uniparty consensus that our pantomime parliament has degenerated into amounts to taxation without representation.\n\nI believe it is the duty of any society worthy of the name to strive to improve and prosper. To ensure that the elderly are respected and cared for and that young people enjoy greater opportunities than their parents. They should receive a first-class education and be encouraged to think freely, not be indoctrinated. They should be able to own a home, a car, a business, be able to travel and have a family. They should not be forced to lead lesser, meaner lives because of a non-existent climate crisis.\n\nWe have given successive governments the finest quality materials to build a prosperous nation with - the ingenuity, creativity and productivity of the British people. \n\nInstead we have endured the same abysmal governance since 1997.\n\nGiven a mandate to reverse the damage done by Labour the Tories have chosen to do the opposite.\n\nFor 14 years they have broken and repeatedly betrayed Britain- a return to Labour will utterly destroy it. \n\nAs we slip down global league tables in terms of economic growth, industrial output, military capability, educational standards, health outcomes and crucially GDP per capita - the only figure that really matters to hardworking people- the failure of successive governments is theirs alone.\n\nThe Tories have printed and wasted hundreds of billions of pounds causing runaway inflation that is being used as taxation devaluing everything you earn and everything you own.\n\nThe only thing they have grown is the size of government and the only things they have invented are new taxes but they have the nerve to tell you there is no room to cut waste.\n\nWe have been continually lied to about immigration. Labour began the process of open-door immigration and the Tories have accelerated it to unimaginable levels, quite deliberately, without providing the infrastructure to cope.\n\nIllegal immigration is a separate issue entirely. Not only are the financial and societal costs enormous but ignoring the obvious national security implications amounts to reckless negligence.\n\nThe Tories have not only neglected our national security for 14 years they have not taken defence seriously yet now they dare to threaten us with war.\n\nThey have drastically reduced the capability of our military, squandered our Defence budget and continued with the imbecilic ideological foreign policies started by Labour. They have even stood by and allowed service personnel to be persecuted for the crime of doing their duty.\n\nThey have deliberately destroyed our energy security and decimated our manufacturing and steel production, vital strategic assets, in the name of idiotic Net Zero hamstringing our nation should we wish to rearm and rebuild our military.\n\nNet Zero is not about Green it is about greed. It is scientifically illiterate, environmentally and economically disastrous, the largest wealth transfer in human history and a deliberate act of national self-harm. Agriculture is the next target. Only Reform has the courage to end this abuse and scrap Net Zero.\n\nSunak and Starmer show their contempt for us by dictating that we can only choose between their two toxic parties. Nowhere else in society is failure continually rewarded, why should it be the case with government?\n\nFor people from any of the legacy parties to stand before us now and make election pledges is an insult to our intelligence. They have had their chances; they have betrayed us entirely so how dare they ask us to ever trust them again?\n\nSitting Tory MPs have not represented your interests while in government, they will absolutely not while in opposition.\n\nA vote for the Tories is a vote utterly wasted.\n\nThere is an alternative. Only Reform UK truly believes in Britain.\n\nWe have produced a comprehensive contract with the people containing detailed, fully costed policies to enable our nation to reverse course and prosper.\n\nEvery single one of these policies is designed to benefit the British people funded by taking £146 billion of your money away from incompetent government and, in the case of our tax cuts, putting it back into your pockets.\n\nWe will cut taxes to make work pay, Reform the NHS and attack government waste putting your money back in your pockets.\n\nWe will support British Farmers, keep farms in family ownership and we are determined to get as much quality British produce onto our tables as possible.\n\nOnly Reform UK will secure Britain’s future as a free, proud and independent sovereign nation.\n\nYou will have heard us say that we want our country back. Back from these shameless careerist, globalist politicians who serve only themselves, their parties and their donors.\n\nWe are sure you want your country back too so please come and support us, make sure that you vote for us and together we will Make Britain Great Again.",

I care about North Durham.\n\nI previously got involved in the Brexit Party as I was very concerned about how the referendum result was being undermined. I had a brief membership with the Conservatives which I cancelled during the handling of the pandemic and dismantling of our economy.\n\nI was personally affected through the loss of a company and was disappointed in the level of propaganda, hype and mis-information that I felt I could no longer be associated with such a disconnected and rotten organisation.\n\nMy experiences and to witness the impact of government decision on friends, family and business associates – in particular in hospitality – simply galvanised me. I can no longer just sit back and watch our country and way of life deteriorate. I like many other voters became dis-illusioned with the 2 party democracy we find ourselves locked in and I am determined to help in any way I can\n\nI am not a politician, far from it. I am a family man and an experienced employer of people who wants to see the North East and North Durham thrive. I am only interested in common sense policies, not waffle. I have lost all trust and faith in our current government, along with the opposition, therefore I question everything that is forced upon us and our country, without a vote. \n\nI stand for better control of the public purse, reducing corporation & VAT taxes to give hospitality businesses in particular a fighting chance, to create more employment opportunities and growth. If we lost our pubs we lose our way of life and a huge social element of our lives. \n\nI stand for families. I believe that everybody should have the aspirations to own their own home, to have their own car and to have that family holiday once or twice a year. To be able to get their children into the local school, to get a doctors appointment or if needed not being put off to a trip to the hospital with a 5 hour wait something to look forward to.\n\nOur culture is being eroded by woke ideology. Our taxes are going up in the name of net zero and our democratic freedoms along with it.\n\nI look across to the EU and I see farmers and truckers protests in Germany and Holland. The rise of the farmers party. They are trying to tell us that food production is under threat in the name of net zero.\n\nI follow the protests in Poland and recently in Spain – with citizens not happy with the way governments are being forced upon them. Belgium in dis-array as digital ID fines start kicking in as freedoms become a thing of the past.\n\nThank goodness we are out of there, we have enough of our own problems, starting with this government.",

Now, Jason will argue in favour of Proportional Representation as Britain’s political landscape is antiquated and requires reform. How can UKIP receive the confidence of almost 4 million voters in 2015 but only get one seat and yet, the SNP receive 1.5 million votes, get 56 seats? This simply doesn't make sense in the 21st century. \n\nHe is a fervent campaigner for equality and raises concerns with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) which he believes is creating divisions in society and that meritocracy must prevail at all times. Britain eliminated the divisions of employing people based on colour and gender years ago but now it seems, has reverted to that philosophy where he believes, will lead to a precarious situation in the future - equality for all under one law must be our focus.\n\nDefence of the realm – our numbers are low in all services to which, the reinvestment of our nations defences is required. The world is going through tumultuous times and Britain is not prepared.\n\nJason is a good speaker and is keen on standing up in front of the public, highlighting Reform UK’s policies and indeed, entering articulate and levelled debates.\n\nWith North Norfolk being declared a dental desert, Jason is keen on ensuring that all its citizens, have easy and affordable dental care available and to eliminate the need for practitioners to leave the area. Jason would launch a campaign to help attract more dentists to our areas. As North Norfolk’s representative, Jason would engage and collaborate with the array of industries locally such as energy, farming and the manufacturing sectors which could help and play a part in the growth of the constituency.\n\nA requirement for more GP's or surgeries, dentists, school places, more police, infrastructure is needed to which, Jason would make the case for in parliament.\n\nJason loves North Norfolk, its coastline, wildlife, landscapes and its communities.

My hometown - Clevedon and it's wonderful, close knit community is one of the most sought after seaside towns in the whole of the UK, it's main attraction is the famous Victorian Marine Lake and Pier. Under this Conservative government we have seen more negative change infiltrating our towns and villages. I joined Reform UK because I strongly believe that if change is going to happen it should be positive.

For example Clevedon seafront, and Portishead and our surrounding areas are a major attraction which could benefit from investment but taxpayers hard earned money has been wasted on pointless other projects.\n\nNorth Somerset is a very peaceful and safe place and we want to keep it that way.\n\nWe decide when changes need to be made, the council is there for us, it spends our hard earned money and they should be held accountable. Reform UK will protect our children from woke agendas. From personal experience I know how harmful it is when ideology and politics is brought into school. Critical Race Theory has no place in our schools.\n\nI will be a part of a party whose aim is to bring back common sense into society and focus on critical reform in all areas. Economy, business, immigration, NHS, education, environment, policing, defence and agriculture to name a few.\n\nI will help support my fellow party members in Reform UK to form a government that is responsible, productive and patriotic.

I joined Reform UK because I believe we do not have a party for hard working people or pensioners. Labour and the Conservatives have successively funded their extravagant ideas via the taxation of hard-working families whilst failing to provide any value for money for the services they receive via their taxation. I previously worked in policing and currently work in finance.\n\nI undertook two degrees one of which is in employment law which has given me a strong understanding of workers’ rights and unlike the Conservatives and Labour I am firmly in favour of a balance between business and trade unions neither holding excessive power which as we have seen with various strikes and poor employee benefits is not beneficial.\n\nWhy vote for me?\n\nI will challenge excessive developments which many residents are concerned with - both Labour and the Conservatives have committed to continue with these due to excessive immigration and poor planning which they have no idea how to tackle.\n\nThe area needs growth and a fair system which is why I support a raise in the income tax threshold to £20,000 to benefit all workers.\n\nLocal policing - anti social behaviour is becoming an ever-dominant issue therefore we need more accountability - the devolution of the PCC Office to the Mayor has reduced the ability to tackle this head on. After previously working in policing, I understand the need for transparency and clear goals therefore I would challenge district commanders on this directly if resolutions are not found.\n\nFinally personal issues - I would personally deal with any issues brought to my office by constituents and set out a plan of how I will tackle any issues raised with each individual.\n\nI am new to politics; I have no desire to be a politician for the entirety of my career but I do believe it is vital that I have some input now. Career politicians have failed to represent the public for far too long, the public sector and its inefficiencies are costing tax payers excessively however I have come from businesses where innovation and value for money is key which is why I believe I could make a difference.",

It appears today, all the main parties act the same, with plausible sound-bite policies and rhetoric, but no meaningful plan for change.\n\nMy Principles\n\nPolitics needs to change by bringing in people with real life experience, who think and talk common-sense. I have three simple but practical principles:\n\n    Fairness – everyone should be treated fairly, and we should play by the same rules.     Meritocracy – opportunities should be given (or at least considered) to people with the right skills, aptitude, and experience.     Democracy – free to discuss opinions and ideas, and then voting on them is a fair and right way to make key decisions.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI have been working for over 40 years and involved in many industries starting out in the nuclear sector and now working in life sciences. I have been an IT project manager for over 20 years so understand how to deliver change by focusing on meaningful outcomes.\n\nThe Environment\n\nI also consider myself as an environmentalist and I want to leave this world in a better state than I found it. Practically, this means I believe that we need strategies for sustainability and energy with the aim of reducing consumption and maximising the natural resource we do have. Whether you believe in “Net-Zero” or not, I do believe we need to ween ourselves off fossil-based fuels by focusing on developing a diverse range of British-owned clean energy technologies and aiming to provide world-leading job opportunities and energy security.\n\nMy Mission\n\nMy hope for the future is that this country becomes functional again, by reducing red-tape and inefficiencies and introducing modern best practices. I will always challenge proposals and seek the undiluted truth, to ensure decisions are fair and deliver high value for the country.",

The Conservatives have destroyed this country, many things are hidden by Wokeism & the push for Diversity & Inclusion, both have pushed the pendulum as far to the left as possible, thankfully people are waking up from the fear of speaking out and are now listening to Reform UK, the only voice of reason.\n\nI am not a ‘typical politician’ my background is in running different businesses, mobile phone, telecoms and packaging materials amongst many businesses.  I have experienced the best and the worst of what can happen in business during my professional career, and have learnt how to deal with real problems where there is nobody else to fall back on, therefore I have the real world knowledge and the business experience to know what is real and fake, there is a huge amount of fakery in the media, I will cut through it, to deal with real issues, especially those relating to the North Warwickshire and Bedworth region. My Personal History\n\nFrom humble beginnings, growing up in Castle Bromwich & attending Park Hall Comprehensive until I was 12 years old, we then moved to Coleshill, North Warwickshire (1979), where I went to Coleshill Secondary school & Coleshill 6th Form, then to NWCTA (North Warwickshire College of Technology & Art) in Nuneaton, studying a two year course, BTec in Business & Finance, then eventually to Birmingham City University studying Industrial Information Technology.\n\nWork Experience; running a mobile phone company Mobile Warehouse Ltd in Sheldon, Birmingham, employing up to 40 people as the company expanded developing into supplying mobile top-up cards and international calling cards to subpostmasters and newsagents across the UK, working closely with the Federation of subpostmasters & attending the national federation of subpostmasters conferences.\n\nFrom 2005, I started Storage & Removal Boxes Ltd, trading as The Box Warehouse, the last several years trading from Coleshill, North Warwickshire.\n\nFor the past 4 years I have been developing & setting up Boxes for Soldiers, a charitable project, to help serving military personnel with receiving care packages. Totally unique, B4S lets military personnel list their needs and wants on a wishlist, then shares it with friends and supporters, when they choose an item or items to send, they are removed from the list so they only get what they need. \n\nWe hope to roll this out beyond serving military personnel to work closely with government agencies to use the same proprietary software I have had developed to help families on low income, veterans and elderly and to ultimately help the homeless.  Why is the Boxes for Soldiers charity different? We take no outside funding or donations, so 100% of any money you give goes to the person, people or families you want to give it too.\n\nWhen elected, I will continue to fight as hard as I can to support British Military personnel both serving and veterans wherever I can, that is my number one personal pledge to you.",

Essentially the choice boils down to; voting for the failing status quo or voting for genuine political change.\n\nLet’s face it, there is barely enough political space between the two major parties to shine a light through. Both are controlled by out-of-touch, career politicians, who believe in high taxes, big government, big debt, globalisation, nanny state regulation and the use of “woke” concepts and scare tactics to further their control over you and your lives. Like me, ordinary people feel neglected, marginalised, betrayed, and without representation. Reform UK will change this!\n\nPolitical elites pay lip-service to the concerns of the public but prove ineffectual. They throw around the word “reform”, but Reform UK are the only party committed to truly reforming Britain’s broken political and national institutions, and finally start putting the interests and prosperity of normal hardworking British citizens first.\n\nUnlike the political establishment Reform UK believe that the people of this country are not stupid! People have their priorities and know what issues/concerns affect them day-to-day. These should be taken seriously. Britain is broken, and the gas-lighting from the career politicians who have broken it, is no longer working.\n\nI grew up and now reside in a local market town, so understand the problems facing the rural towns and villages of Cambridgeshire. Politicians should run to serve the public, not for career advancement, power, prestige or money. If I were returned to Westminster, I would be there to serve you!\n\nI have already been serving this constituency as a frontline NHS worker in all 3 local hospitals for the past 14 years. The NHS is close to all our hearts and an institution in which we British take great pride. But it is failing! I have intimate experience of the problems of waste, bureaucracy, recruitment, retention, rapidly increasing local populations, expensive procurement, creep of gender ideology and EDI initiatives, PFI’s and mismanaged 3rd party contracts. It needs reform and Reform UK is the only party with a bold enough plan.\n\nWhy am I running? I had to think long and hard about whether to stick my head above the parapet, I am by no means an extrovert, I do not crave attention or prestige and there are certainly easier ways to earn money. However, I firmly believe that when life calls you to step up, you must!

Change is long overdue but that needn't mean choosing from the same old stagnant pool of career politicians and party place-men and women.\n\nThere is little difference between Labour and Conservative any longer, they have finally, and inevitably, met in the centre which is precisely where they want to be. Indeed, Keir Starmer's only appeal to conservatives, from the platform at the Labour party conference, was vote for us because we won't be quite as ineffectual as them. Not much of a choice is it?\n\nReform does what it says on the tin. It means real change. Common sense. It means saving Britain from crackpot wokeism, out of control spending, swingeing taxation, Net Zero madness, uncontrolled mass immigration, both legal and illegal, the interfering European Court of Human Rights and the cosy consensus on all of this which we see at Westminster today and which has cost us the real Brexit the majority of people voted for in this constituency\n\nI have already made my home in North West Leicestershire and my young daughter is getting a fantastic education at a great state school in Coalville. I work in Ashby-De-La Zouch and so every day I am seeing the challenges facing local people and they have also been telling me about the issues that concern them.\n\nNorth West Leicestershire needs an MP who follows through on those issues rather than using their platform to campaign prolifically on a single issue. Outside of the incumbent, the rest of us have experience in local government as sitting or former councillors, in business or in public service. I have been a school governor and a Town Councillor. I am a trained nurse who spent 12 years in the NHS and world-travelling IT Consultant. I have worked in Nigeria, Thailand, The USA, The Philippines and, of course, here in the UK.\n\nNorth West Leicestershire needs a bold representative who is returned to parliament to get results. Rishi Sunak has made promises around the restoration of the Ivanhoe line but there has been zero progress on it. Who is there demanding that progress be made? Who is there to protect our rural and agricultural areas from rampant over-development? People are tellng me that they have been let-down and have little confidence in any of the main parties. There is an alternative\n\nIf you really want a determined representative who believes in getting results, then put your cross next to Reform UK on polling day.",

Protecting the environment is of real concern, however government policies have negatively impacted the living standards of people in Scotland and the UK without reducing global environmental harm.

Poor families on council waiting lists, with no houses being built. Planning regulations of a draconian nature exist to throw up barriers instead of facilitating access.\n\nThe council refusing to take responsibility instead of doing the “right thing”. Food banks in Totton and Backfields and Hythe because people cannot afford to buy food due to high prices.  Access to services Drs and Dentists, public transport to the General Hospital and other medical services.\n\nThe New forest is so poorly served by our local ambulance services that some cannot attend or afford a taxi, which is often the advice given. In the Forest itself, we see younger generations driven away because of high costs in both rent and lack of housing, leading to population displacements we can little afford to accept. We have our community nurses struggling to meet demands as the area is so large they cannot reach everyone and have very few staff to do it. Lymington Hospital is always shouting loud for staff to perform the wonderful services they do.\n\nThe council continually failing its people to provide good quality affordable housing and services. Employment has been decreasing limiting access to jobs for young people. Young people simply don’t have the connection or are disconnected from the forest. Local areas surrounding the forest like Totton and waterside are largely built up and are poorly served. For example the wheelie bin scandal is now hitting residents with the unsightly plastic bins left out by many for days causing obstructions and eyesores.. Sewage spillage into the sea around or beautiful coastline are of great concern.\n\nCouncils wasting money on art projects in Totton that have little meaning to residents.  Lurking in the distance is the spectre of Associated British Ports and the loss of our military community in Marchwood. Rising rents for waterside clubs who use the waterways.

I understand the importance of community and as a local businessman who went from Ferguslie Park to Thornly Park, I also know something about aspiration.\n\nI’m married, I have four grown-up children, I’m semi-retired and through business things have changed but I value that upbringing as it made me the person I am today.\n\nI’m a known community campaigner who is well aware of the challenges we have in our areas, I’ve worked on regeneration projects and I’m passionate about building local economies and I will continue to push on regeneration throughout the constituency, to increase local employment.\n\nI’ve recently been successful with the old Royal Alexandra Infirmary despite Renfrewshire Council insisting it couldn’t be done. It is now to become a £15 million pound development of 81 much-needed apartments in the south end of the town.\n\nI have Local Government experience which can help as we seek to reduce the cost of living, improve our public services, fix our roads, deliver new housing, new jobs as these are the things (that really matter most to people) in our towns and villages. Our communities desperately need regeneration and Reform UK’s small business policies would encourage recognised businesses and new entrepreneurs alike to invest in our area.\n\nI have knowledge of how the Conservatives have let us down. I’ve witnessed how the SNP divisive politics has damaged Scotland and how the Labour Party before them almost bankrupted Renfrewshire and I’m worried that Kier Starmer’s Labour will do the same.\n\nI am standing for Reform UK as Government mismanagement means nothing works.\n\nThe social contract is broken, our economy has suffered, our NHS, and our education once the pride of Scotland and the envy of the World has been relegated. I’m saddened that people are either priced out of housing, or there’s not enough social housing, that they can’t afford to heat their homes and have to use food banks, even if they are working.\n\nWhen I read Reform’s Contract With You I was impressed by the amount of common sense proposals it promotes and that sealed it for me. This was more of a movement than just another political party and that is something the whole Country needs at this time.\n\nI believe that Reform UK wants to put the GREAT back into Britain and I want to be part of that, and more than this, – I believe that the majority of Scottish voters want the same too.\n\nReform offers a real alternative to misleading party politics and real policies for the future. It could be the day Britain said – We no longer want more of the same!\n\nIn closing; I hope this bio encourages you to vote for your Local Reform Candidate. I hope you’ll have a look at the website at reformuk.scot, read the Contract and make up your own mind.\n\nYou’ll be warmly welcomed when you come and join us.  Regards,  Jim.",

A man who cannot define what a woman is.\n\nLib Dems are nothing more than virtue signallers, no real policies, but they do support everything else the others stand for.\n\nA vote for any of these parties is a wasted vote. You have an opportunity to send a strong signal this General Election, that you will no longer stand by and accept the current state of affairs.\n\nWe need everyone to come out and vote. If this is to be the punishment election, then so be it, but the way to do it is not to vote for any of these parties. Vote for those prepared to stand for you.\n\nWe need you, the silent majority, to come out and vote for hope and change, not fear.\n\nOur country is under existential threat because the Conservatives are not conservative, because Labour are not for the working class, because Lib Dems are neither liberal nor democratic, and because Greens aren't green.\n\nRemember, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.\n\nMake a difference, send a message, vote Andrei Dragotoniu, vote Reform UK",

No more excuses, just action.\n\n1. Safer streets for everyone.\n\n2. Stop polluting our sea and rivers. \n\n3. A centrally funded toll-free Tamar.\n\n4. Military pay and housing they deserve.\n\n5. Transform empty offices into affordable homes.\n\n6. Uncover the facts about the Armada Way budget. \n\nWhy vote for me?\n\nTo help answer that I’d like to ask you to imagine you telling your friends and family that you're going to stand in the General Election to become an MP. \n\nIf you did tell them, I'm sure you'd get a similar response to what I did (although there were other responses!).\n\n\"Wow, that's great, we need more “normal” people like you as an MP\".\n\nIt's funny though isn’t it, how Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both working so hard to reclaim their working-class roots, toning down their parent's work and showing the public how \"normal\" they are.  \n\nI can't tone down my first job at the council as an apprentice vehicle mechanic fixing anything from lawnmowers to gritters. I can't even claim I was any good at it either which is why I was planning to get into sales as soon as I'd qualified. My Dad was in sales and he played golf every Friday so it looked like an easy option. But my Mum was a crazy artist and she encouraged me to go off travelling to \"see the world\". So I did. And survived. But there were some times when survival was looking a little less likely (I can bore you with my survival stories in the pub sometime.)\n\nBut I've done OK for a normal person. I did eventually get into sales, then fell into recruitment, then got wowed by the Internet in 1998, built a software business, sold it, lost it, started again with nothing, and managed to survive as a self-appointed Internet Recruitment Guru (I'd be known as an Influencer today!). \n\nIn between all of my jobs, I did what Mum said and travelled. Australia, South America, North America, North Africa and more. I also somehow managed to find myself a wife and she even convinced me to settle down and have kids. But though my travel had been curtailed, I still managed to fit in numerous crazy ultra marathons in great places such as the Sahara desert, Amazon jungle, and the Yukon. \n\nBut it's not all about me \n\nMy wife and two daughters have all worked in the care sector; a community physio, a nurse and a Navy medic (although our daughters have picked up the wanderlust now). Having seen them all do work that has a real purpose (unlike selling software), and working throughout the pandemic, when we moved to Sparkwell in 2021 I decided to start working as a volunteer at the Plymouth Soup Run. To do something with purpose, to have a positive impact on those less fortunate.\n\nWhy homelessness? \n\nIt all stems back to a travelling incident in Cusco, Peru in 1994 where I fed some homeless kids for a few days. It's another story for the pub but that experience left me regretting not being able to do more and since then I've always stopped and talked to street homeless people no matter where I am. \n\nPlymouth Soup Run\n\nLife on the streets of Plymouth has got progressively worse since COVID and we have massively increased the number of meals we serve on a Sunday night to over 125. As the numbers increase it becomes far more tense for both volunteers and clients, and the streets feel less safe, so it’s vital that the police can provide a rapid response when (rarely) needed.\n\nDo more\n\nMy first-hand experience on the streets of Plymouth made me realise to be able to do more, I had to do more. So I joined Labour in 2022 hoping I could do more, but that was not to be. So after almost 2 years with Labour, I resigned, thwarted at every step by party politics. Not the party or the people for me. All too angry with the Tories and no focus on the important issues. \n\nBut I’m not someone who gives up easily or makes excuses so I researched Reform UK and realised they have policies I support. Common sense ideas that will make a difference. Not more wishy-washy flip-flop Labour twaddle or delusional Conservative cons. \n\nWhich is why I am standing for Reform UK in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport.\n\nLet’s be honest though; we've all lost trust in politicians who spend more time on political point-scoring and less time on real work. We need business people to fix the country, to hold the councils and the police to account, and to make sure our essential services such as water and housing are at a high standard to ensure the health and well-being of the community. This is why if I am elected I’ll be making LOCAL issues my priority, working with people, regardless of party, to get things done. No lame excuses, just hard work and focus.\n\nYou can find out more about my campaign plans by connecting with me on any of the social media channels below. You can also invite me to your pub for a beer and a few stories any time, and maybe even get a few people together to get more voters on our side.  \n\nJuly 4th is Plymouth Independence Day\n\nVote Reform UK on the 4th July so Sutton and Devonport get an MP who is independent of the Labour Party, the Labour Council and the Conservative Police and Crime Commissioner.\n\nSomeone who will hold them to account and get things done.

These varied experiences have given me a broad view of the needs of Scottish people and has led me to want to work for improved lives and communities locally.\n\nWhy I am standing as the Reform Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Perth and Kinross-shire\n\nI have lived in beautiful rural Perthshire for twenty years and I’m well aware of the challenges in rural areas. In recent years, we’ve seen the loss of post offices and police stations, poor public transport, and a drastic need for housing and jobs to help young people remain in the area. Perth city centre needs regeneration and Reform’s small business policies would encourage new entrepreneurs.\n\nStanding up for local and national concerns\n\nI have an active and successful campaigning record, including leading a campaign to protect our wild peatlands, particularly from industrial energy projects - such as the proposed 200m turbines in Kinross-shire.  I have also brought specific health concerns to the attention of politicians so I know how both parliaments function and how to influence.\n\nReform’s policies on key issues are needed to revive our economy and restore healthy communities.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Knocking on doors to get signatures for my Nomination Form I was surprised at how vehemently anti-politics some people were: ” I don’t have anything to do with politics”. No time to reply.\n\nHowever we all need to acknowledge that we can never be free of politics; every decision of central and local government is political.\n\nMPs should be our representatives, making laws that serve the best interests of the population of this country. BUT in recent parliaments there has been a growing tendency for the government, frequently deferring to foreign governments, judges and international organisations, to decide for us what is in our best interest. We all have had plenty of evidence that nobody in power is willing to take advice from us or, indeed, from experts who disagree with their experts.\n\nThat is why I am standing for election.\n\nI could not stand it any more and decided that as a candidate I would be able to voice my concerns and the law of the land would preserve my right to do so. MPs should be at the centre of debate, gathering information and opinions and alerting their constituents to proposals coming down the line.\n\nMPs should not just be listening to the most vocal but present ideas and evidence to their constituents and lead an open debate.\n\nThis is what I hope to have the opportunity to do and why I have started a Patreon. This is the place where I will write in more detail about what I am reading, what I am seeing and hearing and what I think about it. The facility to ‘post’ and get responses on specific topics should be a great way of learning from the experience and expertise of others.\n\nNot everyone likes to read stuff online so I am also very keen to get information on paper delivered to all constituents. This could be anything from an election leaflet to a call for information or participation. I see this as an important goal far beyond the election. Therefore I am looking to put together a group of volunteers who can distribute information in the streets they choose to adopt. I will be looking to grow awareness of what is being done ‘for our own good’ and encourage people to stand for future elections or support those who do.\n\nIf you want to deliver a few leaflets or start the process of forming local groups of supporters please text your name and ward to me on 07957972306. I will check my messages about 3 times a day and call you.\n\nMore about me: I have been a partner in business with my husband for over 25 years. We have a small print business, serving mostly small businesses, local organisations and families and therefore I get to speak to people in a wide range of circumstances. I have also worked in laboratories, the Prison Service, telecommunications (including 4 years attending CCITT - the international standards organisation for telecommunications) and I have been a student both on leaving school and as an adult in later life. Over 10 years ago my husband and I both became committed Christians and were baptised.\n\nMy interests centre on challenging ‘what we all know”:\n\n* health guidance has been tracked by an ever increasing incidence of ‘diseases of civilisation’; indeed diabetes and its consequences are likely to bankrupt health budgets round the world; * for the sake of a stable future we need to support families with homes to live in, the power to decide on education, the opportunity to earn money and make their own decisions on spending priorities and health;  * I challenge the fear of climate emergency and the arrogance in thinking that we can decide what the climate does and that centralised decisions are better for our future than local farmers adapting as they see the need.",

With a 25-year career supporting the NHS, ensuring that hospitals are equipped to manage the needs of its patients across England and Wales, needless to say the last four years have been the most testing of his career to date.\n\nHe grew up in Wakefield and attended Kettlethorpe High School, followed by A-Levels at Wakefield College. After numerous temporary jobs, including his first job collecting glasses in Legends and Harleys in Castleford at 17-years old, he started working at NHS Supply Chain in Normanton in 1998, where he still works as an Inventory Manager.\n\nJohn has stood for election for several years in Altofts and Whitwood and has been honoured to lead the only Independent party in the Wakefield District. He believes that independence from a party whip is critical to the accountability of an MP to the people he or she represents. With no party whip, Reform UK MPs are accountable only to the constituents and not to big business or big pharma lobbyists.\n\nHe is only interested in serving the people of Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley, not his own political ambitions.\n\nAs a part of the Vote Leave campaign, which won 70% of the votes in Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley in 2016, John knows what it means to fight against the establishment… and win!\n\nJohn has been working with a blockchain developer to develop the UKs first Direct Democracy portal, BlocVote. This will allow people to directly instruct their elected representative of their views, opinions and ultimately how they would like their MP to vote on the most critical of issues to impact our lives. With this system comes the right of Recall. If you are not happy with the performance of your MP…. sack them. No ifs, no buts, they are not doing as they promised they would and are not listening to you… sack them.\n\nIn a direct democracy, power is not concentrated in the hands of a select few, but rather diffused among the masses, allowing for a more balanced and representative decision-making process. It upends the traditional power dynamics, putting the people in control, and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility in the political process.\n\nDo you want a say in the UK’s Net Zero policy, which is making us all colder and poorer? The Tories have introduced this absurd plan and Labour’s plan would cost us £116 billion and has been deemed “unfeasible”.\n\nDo you want a say on excess immigration numbers, both legal and illegal?\n\nDo you want a say on the wasteful and incompetent policy of quantitative easing (printing money) which has led to out of control inflation and the highest tax burden in a generation?\n\nI live in Castleford and have close friends and family in Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley. These towns and communities matter to me…. because I live here. My family lives here and my friends live here. This year vote to change your representative, vote for some real opposition against the Westminster elite.\n\nVote Reform UK in our hometowns.",

I am divorced with four children and three grandchildren.\n\nIt was at the time of the Maastricht Treaty that I came to realise the true nature of the beast. I wrote to Sir George Gardiner, then MP for Reigate, promising my vote for him if he voted against the Treaty. He did, and I was more proud to vote for him in 1997 than on any previous visit to the ballot box.\n\nSir George introduced me to the Campaign for an Independent Britain, an umbrella group for EU-realists from all political parties. I soon realised the big three parties were fully signed up to the European Project, and there was nothing that their rank-and-file members could do about it.\n\nThen I fell in with UKIP. I joined the party in 1999, and I have stood in elections at least once a year since 2000, sometimes twice a year, and three times in 2009. There have been many false dawns along the way, and we have learned just how deeply entrenched are the forces of compulsory integration. But we have also learned to fight harder, and never to be discouraged. I have joked in the past that I have lost count of how many elections I have contested, but not of how many I have won: none. But in May of this year, I came within a whisker of winning two elections.\n\nOf course, I benefitted from the national swing to UKIP which has brought us so many victories and near misses this year, but I like to think that I have built up something of a local presence, with my relentless campaigning and letters in the local press, not to mention getting coverage for some of my less political activities. People sometimes recognise me in the street, and they usually have something supportive to say.\n\nIf we are to achieve our aims, we must broaden our appeal to those who once would have been considered natural Labour supporters. NuLab abandoned them, and they know it. A quarter of a century ago, Jacques Delors seduced British unions with promises of prosperity and security. What we have got is chronic unemployment and stagnant living standards, while a tiny minority have grown stinking rich. I do not blame the EU exclusively for this, but it has been an integral and willing part of the process. I know from canvassing how much potential support we have from the worst hit: men and women who once would have been proud to describe themselves as patriotic socialists, and we know from election results that we are more than the Conservative Party in exile.\n\nI shall never lie to the people of this constituency.

This will cause social problems and more disruption to our existing infrastructure.\n\nAs MP I will campaign for;\n\n1. More frontline NHS staff, cut middle management, focus on better outcomes for patients and a dedicated cancer treatment hospital to rival the best in G7.\n\n2. Campaign for lower energy costs through state owned but public operated energy companies.\n\n3. Secure our Borders – pick them up and immediately drop them back to the EU as per Reform UK 6 point plan.\n\n4. Strong Economy - lower tax, cut regulations get Britain going again.\n\nWithin Rochester & Strood;\n\n1. Work to install quality health care services, GPs, Doctors, Dentists, Carers.\n\n2. Enforce efficient road works – road congestion damages the local economy which impacts us all, keep our roads flowing, no road closures, stop all red routes, Ban ULEZ, LTN and end excessive fines against motorists.\n\n3. Balance the books – no more millions in deficit. Medway must provide value to constituents and relieve pressure from the cost of living crises by stopping local tax increases.\n\n4. Build local economy – no environmental audits, unnecessary bureaucracy. Businesses require more trade through better services, roads, internet, facilities.\n\nExperience;\n\nWorking, Managing & Creating businesses in Construction – Hospitality – Financial Services\n\nPublic Service\n\nBritish Army – Light Infantry\n\nHumanitarian Work – UN in Africa",

As an advocator for positive and practical change I've dedicated my life to public service.\n\nMy 20 years plus working within the industry of mental health and ten years plus as a Mental Health Nurse for both the NHS and local authority, within a multitude of different specialities, has given me a unique perspective on the needs and challenges we face in today's society. I understand the intricacies of working within a political environment, especially in the healthcare sector, and I'm well-aware of the successes and limitations of the NHS. \n\nI also have an extensive background in teaching, having lectured at the University of Cumbria in the field of mental health nursing. In my earlier days and beyond, I was self-employed as a guitar teacher at various music schools in Lancashire over a ten-year period teaching children and adults how to master the art of rock! When I was 19 years old, I was employed by an American summer camp in New Jersey for two consecutive summers to be their music and rock band instructor.\n\nI have lent myself to the pursuit of many interests over the years, not limited to just nursing but including a passion for TV, videography and postproduction having studied for a master’s degree at MediaCityUK. I have seen firsthand what is happening to our institutions, not just in the NHS, but with the BBC and our broadcast media. \n\nOur campaign is grounded in the belief that democracy should be free from coercion, woke ideologies and cancel cultures. I champion a society where common sense prevails, economic growth is high and taxes are low, state interventions are minimal and freedom of speech is preserved.\n\nHaving witnessed alternative approaches to pressing issues, such as spending time in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm convinced that there are better ways to navigate political crises, ways that prioritise our freedoms and choices as well as protecting citizens when the need arises. Freedom is precious - we should never lock down our children again.\n\nMy politics has never changed, it's the parties that have changed. That's why I stand for Reform UK. A vote for Reform UK is a vote for REFORM UK! Let's stand together.",

In 2014, believing the UK has a better future out of the EU, I stood in the local elections on behalf of UKIP. My success resulted in me representing the ward of Heaton (Harold Hill). In 2016, totally disillusioned with the management of the council and total lack of care towards my ward, I resigned my seat in protest. In 2015, I represented UKIP in the General Election. This time in the constituency of Ilford North.\n\nI recently retired as a director of Romford Golf Club to dedicate myself to the upcoming campaign. I have been closely associated with Romford Football Club for many years and was a main sponsor for several seasons.\n\nMy passion has always been canoeing and along with a friend, we started Stubbers Canoe Club some 50 years ago. We still train and compete together but now for Chelmsford Canoe Club. I am qualified for the Olympic white-water course at Lea Valley and still visit occasionally.

        "statement_to_voters": "Our economy has been burdened by high taxation, high inflation, over-regulation and grossly high energy prices. Reform’s policies address all of these. None of the other parties has the answer with Labour proposing even more state interference in our affairs.\n\nReform UK will raise the income tax-free allowance to £20,000 to help the lower paid, wean up to two million people off benefits and into work, invigorate the care sector, hospitality, tourism and farming which rely on lower paid jobs, and show young people the value of hard work. Putting money into people’s pockets will stimulate the economy. Big government is a big problem.\n\nWe can’t afford to pay public employees properly nor adequately fund local authorities, despite the highest taxation in 50 years. High energy prices because of the Net Zero policy affect all areas of the economy and household budgets.\n\nThe SNP and Conservatives are unfit to govern and are in disarray. Labour’s policies would fan the flames of economic decline. It is time to change politics for good. Please vote for me and Reform UK.\n\nCredentials\n\nMy first job was in my father’s shop in Main Street Rutherglen while studying to be an architect at Strathclyde University. My first lesson was that the customer always comes first.\n\nWhen I married, I bought a house in Uddingston but during the 1970s energy crisis interest rates soared to 15% and I couldn’t afford the mortgage despite having two jobs. Luckily, I got a job at Cumbernauld Development Corporation with a key worker council house which I later bought. This gave me equity to buy into the architectural practice in which Charles Rennie Mackintosh used to work.\n\nMy first project back in Glasgow was Parkhead Forge Shopping Centre and then the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank. As managing director from 1994 to 2008, the practice grew from 40 people in Glasgow to over 300 in five UK and international offices. We delivered schools for 75,000 children. When designing hospitals I studied healthcare systems in Canada, France and Japan, learning that the NHS way is not the only way.\n\nI designed offices for the British National Oil Corporation in Glasgow after this state energy company was set up in 1975. It was a white elephant by 1982, proving that businesses run by politicians and civil servants inevitably fail, as we would find out if Labour or the SNP nationalised the energy industry now.\n\nI was proud of the energy efficiency of our buildings, the Scottish Natural Heritage HQ in Inverness winning the most sustainable UK office building of the year award. Wind and solar power did not make the business case and at Forth Valley Royal Hospital we rejected biofuels as very inefficient and expensive – they actually produce more CO2 emissions than burning gas. After I retired I considered whether renewables were also unfit for purpose at a national scale. They were, and I published my conclusions in a 2023 book – Climate Change for Young People: The Antidote to Eco-anxiety.",

There’s something special about this area - whether it’s our sporting champions; our rich medieval and Georgian history; or our local traditions. I can’t remember an Easter Monday I haven’t spent at the Medbourne-Hallaton bottlekicking, and my times at local point to points are some of my favourite memories.\n\nBy volunteering I have helped the elderly and disabled, which has taught me the value of community; something that continues to be eroded by sweeping changes across this country. Beleaguered NHS waiting lists; millions out of work; small businesses struggling - our towns and villages become service and pub deserts, which erodes at community.\n\nWhilst I worked in Brussels advocating for rural interests across Europe, I learned just how few voices there are making the case for common sense countryside policy. I had hoped that Brexit would help us break free from continental-style climate targets and metropolitan sensibilities. Back home, however, I’ve had to watch our fields plastered over to make way for expensive, destructive projects such as Mallard Pass Solar Farm. \n\nA motorsport engineer by education, I am appalled to see Labour councils up and down this country enact ULEZ regulations and speed restrictions while elected Conservatives stand by idly. These are unscientific and if you have a basic understanding of how an engine works you will know that you use more fuel at lower gears with higher revs. Travel restrictions like these are a tax on working people and a grab at our freedom - I am determined to stop their creep into Stamford and Rutland.\n\nSmall businesses are the lifeblood of Rutland, and I plan to push for legislation that would remove tax from small businesses and properly tax large businesses. It is unfair for small shops to shut on the high street due to tax when they already have enough overheads to pay for. There must be responsibility for closures on the high street, and increased taxes are forcing higher running costs with expensive energy and water bills is squeezing the high street.\n\nWe have a huge amount to protect within our constituency. With a rich history spanning from the beautiful Normanton Church on Rutland Water, which was saved by protests from people locally (something maybe for the current government to listen to about Mallard Pass Solar Farm!) to the location of Isaac Newton’s apple tree.\n\nThere is an increasing frustration with Tory policies that actively denigrate the countryside, and despite being voted in by the rural communities, have an inability to act in those community’s defence - instead appealing to metropolitan voters who do not support them\n\nThe demonisation of farmers by our politicians must stop, and we can see across Europe the support that farmers have, and under Labour this will continue until the country consists of just soulless mega-farms.\n\nMallard Pass Solar Farm is something that the conservatives have not managed to stop and will destroy a huge swathe of our beautiful counties and it is absurd that it was allowed to go through in the first place.",

We must act now to reverse this awful trend.\n\nDid you know Southern Water spilt raw sewage into the River Test and Blackwater 699 times in 2023?\n\nThe farming community needs help with feeding an increasing population, irrigation of farms, recruiting young people, rural crime prevention, and ever-increasing energy costs.

Interesting times took me to Scotland, offshore, Norway, Holland and eventually Libya on what is now the world’s largest irrigation project, where I thoroughly enjoyed the mild African sun 1,000k down into the Sahara, and working in Benghazi next to a tank training camp, with roadside SAM pods during the conflict between Reagan and Qaddafi in 1986!\n\nFollowing that brief sojourn, I studied for (and happily passed) the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at Cranfield School of Management – currently ranked at #80 in the world, in a market of over 16,000 organisations offering that qualification.\n\nCranfield changed my life and on graduating I worked for Hoskyns, at the time the preeminent software and services company in the UK which was subsequently acquired by Cap Gemini, one of the world’s largest IT services and consulting businesses.\n\nBut ‘big company’ didn’t suit me and in 1990 I formed my own business – a software organisation which I grew to over 70 people based in Surrey and Salem, just north of Boston in the US.  The timing was good as Microsoft Windows was new to the market and our skills helped us develop image-based systems for the UK Police Service and ultimately a market-leading Customer Service system (which would now be labelled as Customer Experience Management) which came to be used by dozens of leading brands such as BT Chairman’s Office, Next, O2, WH Smith, Toyota, Hertz, McDonalds and many more.  It is now used by over 70,000 complaints handling system users for one of the UK’s ‘big four’ banks.\n\nAfter 12 hard years I left the business and since then have enjoyed a relatively quiet life, with a few incursions back into business and other activities.  I did a 3-year stint in East Lancs around Accrington and Oswaldtwistle as the borough’s ‘Enterprise Facilitator’, helping people convert from ‘employment to enterprise’ by setting up or growing their own business.  We helped dozens and dozens of people.\n\nI also worked with the UK’s largest ‘business angel’ company (at the time), connecting high-net-worth people with businesses seeking investment. And I helped a young man set up a marketing agency, sell it and now over 15 years since we met, I’m still involved!\n\nAnd during all that time, I managed to live in the Czech Republic for 6 years!\n\nBut some places get their nails into you, and so it is with Cranfield.  In 2019 I was asked to become President of Cranfield School of Management’s Alumni Association (of over 35,000 people across the globe).

        "statement_to_voters": "My name is Chris Harrison, and I am honoured to have been selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Reform UK in South Norfolk.\n\nI moved to Norfolk in 1992 to pursue a PhD at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. The first house I lived in as a postgraduate student was in what is now the South Norfolk Constituency. My career began in research and later transitioned to management and director roles within the university sector.\n\nSince 2012, I have been active in the private sector, primarily working with start-up companies focused on commercialising innovative products and concepts. Recently, I served as the managing director of a plant-based food venture in Norfolk, collaborating with scientists, farmers, and major retailers, food distributors, and catering services, including school catering.\n\nTen years ago, I founded a retail business that has steadily grown. What started in my office now supports a small team in a Norfolk village high street location.\n\nI am married to a full-time GP, and I have worked with healthcare-related businesses, gaining a deep understanding of the NHS's challenges. Healthcare is a daily topic in our household.\n\nI have a 17-year-old daughter studying graphic design at a college in Norwich. As she prepares for university next year, we are experiencing the challenges faced by her generation, especially following the pandemic.\n\nWhy Reform UK?\n\nI previously represented the Conservatives as a Broadland District Council councillor and have been a Conservative supporter since my student days in Leeds, despite its unpopularity there at the time. However, recent events, especially during and after the pandemic, have left me disillusioned with the Conservatives. I have come to agree with the view that they are self-serving and do not truly represent the views of the country or their voters. The internal conflicts and leadership appointments disregarding membership wishes have solidified this perspective.\n\nReform UK offers a fresh approach. The people I have met and the other candidates in the election come from diverse backgrounds, many with experience in small businesses or vital public services. We share a belief in the need for radical change and breaking the stronghold of the two major parties. I found a political home here – one where I didn't need to be part of the political elite or a PPE graduate from Oxford to be accepted.\n\nI bring to the party a wealth of experience in both the public and private sectors across various industries. I have started and run small businesses and negotiated deals with international household-name companies. Despite my extensive education, I come from a humble background; my parents owned a guest house in Morecambe, where I grew up.\n\nI understand and love the rural economy here in South Norfolk and am part of it, while also recognising the significant opportunities from nearly 30,000 people working at Norwich Research Park. I aim to maintain our way of life while increasing the money in your pocket through lower taxation, better and more efficient public services, and cutting waste in unaccountable bodies like the BBC, the House of Lords, and numerous NHS management organisations.\n\nWorking in science and highly-skilled workplaces has shown me the immense value of skilled people coming to the UK. Some of my best friends are those who have come here to work. However, even they acknowledge that unchecked immigration could harm the UK. The Labour government under Blair eroded immigration controls, leading to an almost free-for-all situation. This shift has resulted in an addiction to cheap labour, which continues today.\n\nIssues like migration and crime were major concerns in 2007. However, a financial crisis, a decade of austerity, a pandemic, and now war have exacerbated the lack of political focus in this area. Those factors are in the backdrop, but it is the Conservative government’s failure to act has left us in this position. Policies like the Rwanda plan are mere gimmicks and will waste time and money.\n\nI hope that after reading this, you will consider supporting me. In return, I promise to work hard for you and be a force for good and change.",

It’s time to accept that the old allegiances are dead. Labour holds working Britons in contempt, the Conservatives have conserved nothing, and the Lib Dems show little understanding of, or sympathy for, liberal democracy.

Our system is fundamentally wrong, and we need real and lasting positive change so that everybody’s vote counts.\n\nMore and more people in the Sevenoaks area are quite rightly frustrated by the failure of our government to deliver on promises made in manifestos. Instead of ensuring our roads are safe and pothole-free, that we can see a doctor or dentist when we need to and that we can travel around on our public transportation system, reliably, on time and at a reasonable cost, attention seems to be on banning a type of dog and smoking.\n\nGovernment and Councils are waging a war on motorists with ULEZ, LTN, fuel duties and rising taxation, disproportionately affecting hard-working people who rely on vehicles to get to work, often providing key public services.\n\nWe have an energy crisis, a housing crisis, an immigration crisis, a health crisis, an economic crisis, councils are going bust, hard work is rewarded with higher taxation so more and more people are choosing not to work.

After graduating from Reading and Keele, he worked all over the UK, and Georgia USA, as a teacher of Politics, English and maths. He also ran two businesses that produced educational software. He wrote and published two political thrillers, The Plutonium Factor and Mohembo Crossing, and, more recently, A Good Death; a novel concerning a family in crisis.\n\nPolitically, Michael emerged from the disintegrating labour movement of his youth to encompass in his later years the more visionary and solid foundations of UKIP and Reform UK, where the concept of the nation-state is favoured over the globalist intentions of the EU, the WEF and Davos. Yet the full opportunities of Brexit have not been embraced by the Tory Government. Instead, we’re still mired within the tentacles of the globalist food and energy markets, where a Russian invasion can push gas prices through the roof and create a cost-of-living crisis in the UK. If we do nothing else, we must become energy-independent.\n\nApart from the dalliance in his youth, and working for Brexit during the referendum campaign, Michael has resisted political activism. But he feels Britain is now so broken, in so many ways, that he feels compelled to try and do something about it. Reform has many sound ideas for making Britain great again. Here’s just one of them. Immigration\n\nIn 2016, the British people voted not just for control of our economy, they also voted for control of our borders. But, yet again, the Conservatives have reversed that notion. They promised immigration of tens of thousands a year. Instead, over 2 million people legally migrated into the UK in 2021 and 2022. In 2023 it’s set to reach 1.2 million. Illegal migration is costing the taxpayer £8 million a day in legal fees, allowances and accommodation. Since 2010, net migration has added 3 cities the size of Birmingham to the population.\n\nSo what, you might ask? Surely it shows we’re a generous nation and net migration strengthens the economy does it not? Well, no actually; mass immigration weakens the economy. It floods the job market with relatively cheap labour, which depresses the wages of the indigenous population. Also, the dependents of migrants tend to be non-working and reliant on state support.\n\nWhat’s more, it’s fine to signal our virtue as a caring nation but what has it done to our ailing infrastructure: housing, schools, doctors’ surgeries, to mention just three? Reform has detailed policies for stopping the boats and ending mass migration. This way we can support genuine refugees.",

Following this I graduated from Leeds University with a degree in Computer Science which started me on my career in IT. After working in Leeds for many years, followed by several more years in the London area I returned home to Lincolnshire in 2014 and now live just outside Lincoln. I currently work for the University of Lincoln as a computer network engineer.\n\nLike many of you I voted to leave the European Union, and I expected the politicians to carry out our orders without fuss. They did not. That spurred me to join the Brexit Party in 2019 to campaign in the European Parliament elections, which we won, and later in the general election of 2019.\n\nI hoped that I would never have to campaign again, that Boris would lead us into a period of stability and prosperity but sadly things have not turned out like we all hoped. So I applied to Reform UK to ensure the people have a choice of a candidate who truly believes in conservative and libertarian values, including:\n\n - Making the best out of Brexit by truly diverging from EU regulations and forging our own path\n\n - That free market economics are the only proven path to prosperity, central state control only causes poverty and misery\n\n - Our hard won liberty and freedoms should not be given up, with freedom of speech being the most valuable and most at threat",

As the Falklands War was raging my dad was stationed in Pembrokeshire. I was a “base baby.” After a bit of a nomadic existence we eventually settled down in Bristol. Yet, we were regular visitors to Southampton. My grandparents still lived at the top of Thornhill Avenue. My sisters and I spent some of the most magical moments of our childhood here. Grandad would recount his tales of travelling the world with Cunard, whilst Nanna would fix up the best homecooked chips. Naturally, I was inducted into Saints mania from an early age. “Do and say what you want, but don’t tell your mum!” whispered my uncle as I watched, from the terraces, Richard Hall slam in his first header in a 2-2 away draw with Bolton Wanderers in early 1992. I was instantly hooked. \n\nBetween 2007 and late 2021 I had worked in London, latterly in senior roles overseeing the conduct of business in the financial markets. Building upon these experiences, I founded a consultancy in late 2021. Headquartered near Southampton Airport, this business has rapidly grown to become a trusted adviser to entities in the UK and beyond. \n\nAs a small business owner, the prospect of a Labour government fills me with dread. This shambolic Conservative administration has already made the UK uncompetitive by raising corporation tax on companies with profits over £250k from 19% to 25%. A Labour party addicted to spending other people’s money and interfering would only make matters worse. If they can’t manage the finances at Southampton City Council, then why should we entrust them with running the world’s 6th largest economy? At Reform UK, we are committed to reducing the tax and regulatory burdens on entrepreneurs. We would bin the oppressive IR35 rules on sole traders, lift the VAT threshold to £100k and cut corporation tax to 15% from year five. \n\nAs a father, I abhor the thought of Labour turbo-charging the woke nonsense that has infiltrated our schools. The “Conservative” Party has indulged the proliferation of harmful and divisive race and gender ideologies. Enough. Reform UK would banish both from our education system within 100 days of taking office. \n\nFinally, as a citizen I believe it is critical that we break the addiction to uncontrolled mass immigration. Since Blair took office in 1997 successive governments, Labour and Conservative, have shown complete contempt for public opinion on this issue. With public infrastructure, housing stock and, in some places, social cohesion under severe strain, reform of our immigration system is now a matter of national security. Reform UK would introduce a selective, skills based, legal entry scheme. Unlike Labour, Reform UK would operate a zero tolerance approach to illegal migration rather than reward it with a de facto amnesty. Equally, Reform UK would seek the immediate deportation of foreign nationals who commit criminal offences here. \n\nOn 4th July the choice doesn’t have to be between failed incumbency and Starmergeddon.

Raising the tax threshold to £20,000 would immediately help those in low-paid employment.  Reducing VAT on energy bills and reducing fuel duty would lower inflation, thereby benefiting both consumers and businesses.\n\nLowering corporation tax from the record high 25% would attract foreign investment and manufacturing to the UK.  Future employment prospects would be more certain, unlike now.  These policies will stimulate growth and make the country more prosperous.\n\nThe UK needs a workable immigration system such as other modern countries operate to enable us to choose those that would make a contribution to our nation. Having valid health insurance and employment skills to enter the UK would be just two requirements.\n\nI am fully behind our party's stance over illegal migration and the plan to stop the boats and take the occupants of those boats, back to France.  The Conservatives wont stop the boats. Labour have agreed with Brussels, to fly migrants into the UK from the EU.\n\nI support reducing foreign aid and redirecting that money to help rebuild public services that have been decimated through underfunding.\n\nReforming the NHS means redistributing NHS finances to enable the training and retaining of doctors. Doing away with those wasteful management posts listed as diversity and equality officers, would leave more cash for patient care. Reform sees everyone as one people in one nation, regardless of ethnicity, colour or religion. Abolishing degree entry for nurses would attract more people into the profession.\n\nOur country needs an affordable integrated transport system if we are to reduce congestion on our roads and combat subsequent pollution.  Petrol and diesel vehicles should be retained until viable alternatives are ready.\n\nConsecutive Tory governments have reduced our armed forces to a dangerous level, unable to respond to overseas threats.

Prior to joining the Reform party, I had voted for Brexit to see change and change is what is desperately needed in Slough. \n\nFrom the people I speak with and the comments online and articles in the Observer, Slough is desperate for change. Slough is a multicultural town with a great history, a good rate of employment and with pretty good transport links by bus and rail. That said, we do not have a cinema, a theatre, practically no nightlife, no music or food festivals and no arts and crafts fairs.\n\nThe town's shopping centre issue is well known and even though the work has not started, the estimate is that it will take fourteen years to complete. I can count on one hand the number of branded or franchise shops, restaurants and bars. There are numerous drink and drugs issues in the town centre as well as homeless people from the centre to Wellington Street.  I have always delivered on projects; commitments and I am a great motivator of people.\n\nI would use all of these skills and absolute dedication to making Slough a better place to visit, not just for the people of Slough, but to bring people into Slough who now go elsewhere due to the lack of any excitement in the area. To do this, people who genuinely want change need to vote for me on election day.\n\nIf you do not vote, you will just get more of the same, especially from Labour who have had twelve years to get Slough to where it is now.

Already, I could see how much government decisions affected the people.\n\nAt that time, it seemed that the working class were automatically Labour voters and the well to do, Conservative. I always wondered why they wouldn't switch even after being let down and having to struggle because of broken manifestos. I made my mind up not to be loyal to a party, but to support those dedicated to making better decisions to help the people. Simply put, if the party in power didn't deliver on their promises, I wouldn't vote for them.\n\nBecause I believe this country can be successful, I became a UKIP member, then joined the Brexit Party, and now I am standing for the Reform Party. I believe this country can be innovative and successful in manufacturing. This country can create and renew its infrastructure. We can improve our agriculture and grow more and better food – rather than filling the countryside with solar panels. We can even immediately start on the chronic housing shortage by making full use of brownfield sites.\n\nOn energy, I think we can do a lot more on the small scale. Personally, I think those in the right properties to have solar should get it for free and feed what is unused back to the grid. Similarly, I believe 'tulip turbines' are a great way of producing energy that placed correctly in gardens could run all day.\n\nI believe in nationalising the utility companies. Thames Water is a fine example of how these privatisations have worked. It has £18 billion in debt borrowed against 80% of its assets (they can only legally borrow 60%), and now they want a 40% increase in your water rates to pay this off.\n\nI also believe we also need to address carcinogenic chemicals in our environment and, particularly, stop fluoride being added to our water supply – a chemical which is a poison.\n\nLet's really start addressing our problems. The Reform Party UK is the only party that is prepared to deal with the big issues we face today and that's why I'm standing.\n\nThe Conservatives have bankrupted this country. They just don't care. Look at their involvement with PPE contracts, the millions wasted on shoddy or useless goods and later on burning these same goods. Johnson, Truss and Sunak did not chase the money back as those getting the contracts were party donors. We could have used this on the NHS, schools, training apprenticeships, and even repairing potholes.\n\nIf you vote Conservative, it's a vote for continued hardship, increases in the cost of living and chaotic government.\n\nIf you vote Labour, you get Starmer with Blair, his mentor and advisor, over his shoulder. You get faith in international organisations and none in the UK. Starmer and Co. believe in the W.H.O. control and the W.E.F. and for your votes not to count. You get Starmer inching back to closer ties with the EU – and eventually rejoining – and chipping away at the sovereignty that we have been able to carve out for ourselves. But, of course, he's difficult to pin down as at any given time Starmer will say whatever he thinks will get Labour in power.\n\nWe need so much to be repaired and renewed. We need to be able to make living affordable again. Only Reform's Contract will deal with these issues.\n\nWe need to change the people running the UK. We have bad management and need a new board of directors. We need new people and especially those with business experience to sort the problems out, to revive the UK PLC and to let us prosper again.\n\nThis is not about one person standing for parliament. This is about changing the management at the top.\n\nThe more Reform candidates we elect the better chance this country has of surviving and dealing with the many issues we face.\n\nOur priority must be changing the management of our government to better the lives of the British people.",

My family background is in shipbuilding, steelwork, and heavy industry. I have had a long career in financial services, and I am proud of the history of our city but wish for a safer, prosperous, and prouder future.\n\nLike many residents, the city holds a special place in my heart. I am not a career politician parachuted into Sunderland from hundreds of miles away, but I care deeply about the direction our city is heading in. Sunderland’s best days could well be ahead of us if we are willing to push for a brighter future. Reform UK is the only show in town to deliver this bright future!\n\nMy main political points of concern facing Sunderland are:\n\n- Lifting the tax threshold to £20k gives Sunderland workers an extra £1,500 a year in their pocket, thus helping reduce the 5.5 million in out-of-work benefits by making work pay.\n\n- Campaigning for net zero immigration to stop wage compression and secure our borders by a zero-tolerance approach to illegal boat crossings.\n\n-Attracting high-quality and well-paid employment to Sunderland by backing the return of maritime industries via the existing government national shipbuilding strategy, along with scrapping business rates to encourage small businesses to thrive.\n\n-Cheaper energy and zero NHS waiting lists via our fully costed plan at: https://www.reformparty.uk/reformisessential\n\nVote for change this election, vote to make Britain great, and vote Reform UK for Sunderland Central.",

        "statement_to_voters": "My name is Sarah Wood and I am the parliamentary candidate Reform UK Party in the soon-to-be amended seat of Spen Valley (currently Batley & Spen).\n\nI am a professional chartered engineer of 21 years born in Halifax, live within Spen Valley, having spent a lifetime here, connected through the family. I want to be your MP and represent your voice in Parliament.\n\nI am compelled to stand for my home seat of Spen Valley because, as a mother, a wife, and a citizen of this country, I am deeply concerned with the direction those in power are taking this nation I love. This is being felt by me at both a National and Local Level and now pervades every area of my life.\n\nI went from being apathetic about politics to deeply caring about the future of my son’s life in our once amazing Country.\n\nI could not, with all integrity, sit back and watch the shocking disassembly of democratic systems, which I once took for granted, accompanied by the unashamed mass removal of our freedoms.\n\nEverything Now Feels Like One Constant Battle: A fight to get a GP appointment A struggle to get a flight on holiday because of the EU Net Zero Caps A challenge to speak to anyone human to access basic services within 2 hours A confrontation at schools to ensure the safeguarding of my son during his education A grapple with people in positions of medical power to ensure sovereignty over my own body A scrap concerning freedom of movement in my own neighbourhood, let alone in the EU A wrestle with my bank about when and how I may withdraw my money A fracas with the public sector referees who are supposed to be upholding my rights against the behemoth of big business; or a skirmish with employers who seek to steamroller my liberties; And a battle royale for things that we’ve fought and won already, which should have been nailed in their coffins long ago, like Brexit and the deliberate state of our porous borders. In fact, as I say these words, it feels less like a battle and more like – controlled demolition.\n\nI bring my honesty, skill, technical experience, leadership, clarity, compassion, and resourcefulness into the constituency I now live in with my husband, where we raise our child alongside yours.\n\nI offer my services to you to uphold your values and add them to our fight. I’m aligned with the principles and values of the Reform UK Party, having evolved from the Brexit Party, whom I stood for in my birth constituency of Halifax in the General Election of 2019.\n\nI know already from speaking to many people in the constituency, that I am also aligned with YOUR values and beliefs, dearly held in Spen Valley.\n\nThere is much placed upon politicians for the state of the nation. Blame, grievance , and resentment. I agree that there are many corrupt holders of public office who sorely need to be held to account. Let’s do that!\n\nHowever, I share with you an additional important view:\n\nIf the power is with the people, then so, too, is accountability. A lack of care for the slipping standards is for the people and only the people to account for.\n\nFor too long, we have given our power away. And THIS is why I stand. I’m taking back my power to make the change I want! I need your help.\n\nWill you stand with me? Will you take your power back? I’m building a team as I write. It’s the only way. And the time is NOW.”\n\nMore Personal Details:\n\nI am 46 years old, and I live in Spen Valley, West Yorkshire, with my husband and son. My early career began when I entered R.A.F Pilot Training whilst reading Aeronautical Engineering at Salford University.\n\nLater, pursuing Engineering around the globe with Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd, BMW Group, Rolls Royce plc, and Jaguar Landrover.\n\nAfter 14 years, I took a career break when I worked with young boys in West Yorkshire with Emotional, Social, and Mental Health Challenges. I then became a professional musician and toured the world.\n\nUpon returning to Yorkshire, I qualified as a Secondary School Teacher of Engineering Design & Technology at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\nI hold a keen interest in supporting boys to thrive in a world which increasingly holds oppression toward men.\n\nI speak three European Languages and am schooled in Classical Guitar. I regard people and the arts as the “Energy of Life.”\n\nAfter a life spent away from home and having returned to my roots. I spend as much time as possible in ”Cleckheaton, Huddersfield, and Halifax with my family and friends.\n\nI am proud to be able to follow in the footsteps of Granddad Albert, who was a Justice of the Peace in Halifax in the 1960s.",

My business, in commercial and high spec residential interior design, has been running now for over 30 years and clients have included the Houses of Parliament . . . remember that wallpaper at £200 per roll? - now there’s a story I can tell you!\n\nInterests of mine, apart from interior design and architecture, include travel, cooking, eating fish and chips on the beach and the arts. Current aﬀairs and political debate, especially in a pub with a roaring fire and glass of wine in hand - perfect. My political interest increased over Brexit. I am a Brexiteer and like many, am furious that it has been ‘done’ in name only . . . what a waste of an 80 seat majority, which clearly shows through lack of action that the government never intended to implement Brexit it was all a sham to gain votes.\n\nDuring the Brexit debates I often heard a businessman - Richard Tice - clearly stating the reasons to vote for Brexit and no-one else made more sense than he did (apart from Nigel Farage of course). The arm twisting and propaganda which went on to coerce the public to vote Remain used to send me into orbit! - just think how many more would have voted Leave if the the debate had been fair and presented both sides of the argument. The BBC were a disgrace during the debates - a tax payer funded organisation which gave little or no voice to those arguing to leave the EU.\n\nThe final push I needed to put my head above the political parapet was the incompetence shown by all political ‘leaders’ during the pandemic and the censoring of free speech. Then the debacle which has led to the UK having an unelected PM foisted on us who, not only supports Central Bank Digital Currency (Mr. Sunak was the poster boy for CBDC when Chancellor) but as Chancellor he completely mismanaged the UK finances with reckless spending and out of control borrowing. This unelected PM also supports the WEF - he has just allowed two members of his Cabinet to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nReform UK is the only party with sound, common sense policies. We are against CBDC and against the WEF.

I will not stand for the continued incompetence, bordering on deliberate destruction of our country.\n\nOnce elected, I will fairly represent the constituents of South Suﬀolk and welcome your support and in doing so, we will definitely Reform the UK to Save Britain.

        "name": "Dave Poole",
        "statement_to_voters": "Hi, I am Dave Poole, your Staffordshire Moorlands Reform UK candidate.\n\nMy early years were difficult, having left school in the mid 1980's as local industry was in decline after years of strikes and mismanagement through the 1970's, despite Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government trying to piece the country back together, this had not made it to the outreaches of rural Cheshire.\n\nI was employed on various youth training schemes (remember them?) as a welder and vehicle technician, but eventually settled on the up-and-coming mobile phone repair industry. Predominantly self-taught, as there was no training available in such a young industry, I spent many years working for The Caudwell Group at their technical facility, \"The Mobile Phone Repair Company\", before progressing to D2D, latterly Celestica UK, and working on mobile phone repairs for leading manufacturers, such as NEC, Motorola, Orbitel etc, at their Chemical Lane site in Stoke. Having decided that the industry was becoming too corporate I decided, \"out of the blue\", to venture into the vehicle breakdown and recovery industry, previously our family trade.\n\nIn 2008 I bought my first truck, and over the years steadily grew my business up to the 15 vehicles that I operate today, in and around the Cheshire/Staffordshire areas. This was achieved through pure hard work and dedication, having never asked a bank for a penny, even during the pandemic. during this period, I kept all of my staff in full time employment, taking no wages myself, and without reducing staff wages, or placing any of them on furlough.\n\nIn 1998 I married, after being several years in a relationship, my wife Julie, and we have a son together.  Julie is my rock and keeps me grounded, supporting me in everything I do. We have a deal, every time I get another classic car, Julie gets a new cat!\n\nI was first awakened to the chaos of politics a number of years ago, during a drive to Africa. My long-standing friend passed me a copy of Private Eye magazine, and after reading about my local council, featuring regularly in the \"Rotten Boroughs\" section, I was enraged, and as a consequence, spent many of the following years studying the workings of local and national government. The conclusion of these years of study?  I felt I simply had to get involved.\n\nI soon discovered that all was not as it seemed, especially during my first attempt at standing in my local town council elections. \"If they don't want you in, they will do everything in their power to stop you, fair or foul\". Social Media campaigns were blatantly manipulated, with myself and my supporters blocked from making comments, unable to defend against false accusations, with anyone not placed on the \"blocked list\" swiftly denied access to comments. Derogatory remarks about me consequently filled local Social Media pages, but I still came second!\n\nSeveral weeks then passed, and a By-Election was called, so I brushed himself down and thought \" what the Hell, people want a fighter, not a \"yes man\".......here we go again\".\n\nAnd with this time a clean fair fight, I won, beating the Labour candidate by 17 votes. A classic case of David and Goliath. with this David's team consisting of only four people, battling against a massive, well-oiled Labour machine. More recently, I stood in what are termed \"all out elections\", and thanks to my small team's hard work and dedication, came within 57 votes of beating the leader of Cheshire East Council.  Quite an achievement, in just three short years of being involved in politics.\n\nFollowing on from various my successes in town council elections, I feel this is the time to play my part in stopping the \"free fall\" that this country has been in for far too long now, with nearly all areas of central government being very obviously in need of massive reforms, and both Labour and Conservative parties having no will to carry them out.\n\nIndustries such as agriculture, engineering, manufacturing to name but a few, are all over regulated, and our economy is paying a heavy price, making us all poorer as a result.\n\nOur law and justice institutions are not fit for purpose, educational standards are \"far from the mark\", with our young generations being taught nonsense, and with no focus on our cherished history, which I consider to be the building blocks of our national identity.\n\nThank you for reading, and please feel free to get in touch with me, I would very much welcome your thoughts and comments, together with your experiences/frustrations, regarding the current shambolic political scene, both on a local and national level, a shambles which is affecting all of our lives, and creating unnecessary suffering for many of us.\n\nQuite simply, voting for me on July 4th, will be a vote for a return to Common Sense.",

We’re re-locating both our home and business to Kidsgrove where we hope to build upon our modest success.\n\nIn the forty-one years since I left school at sixteen, life has been a constant struggle through successive red and blue governments plundering our nation’s wealth, our industries, our social housing and our very identity. \n\nWhen my first-born came into the world, I was just nineteen and we lived in a Council flat. I worked three jobs over seven days a week just to provide for my small but rapidly growing family - so I really do understand hardship, struggle and what it means to go hungry – hence my ambition and drive to climb out of poverty trap we were in.\n\nOver the years I’ve had my feet in both political camps in an attempt to bring about change – only to realise that they only care about their own agenda, not the betterment of Great Britain. \n\nI was an Independent Chairman of my local Council, I was also Chairman of my local Constituency Labour Party (a position I rapidly abandoned when Corbyn became party leader) and latterly, a fully paid-up Conservative – but not any longer, Britian needs change.\n\nI became a Trustee and Director of my former local Miners Welfare Charity, I can say, hand on heart, that saving the charity from closure has probably been my best project and success to date.\n\nThe Miners Charity provided the area with a youth club, social club, both adult and junior football & cricket clubs, a Pensioners club and a bowls club – All of these vital community assets would have been lost forever because the District Council did not and would not provide them.\n\nI have always been a staunch Brexiteer – even before the term was invented.

I was living in Fenton at the time. I then concentrated on business and family. I had always wanted to leave the European Union even though I accepted the democratic decision to be in it. However after the Tory Party failed to honour its promises on the\n\nReferendum vote I became active with the Brexit Party and continued to be active when it ultimately transformed into the Reform Party.\n\nI was asked to stand by fellow campaigners, although I was reluctant at first, I am fighting for my country and the Sovereignty of its people, this is where it has led me.\n\nI am deeply troubled by the current levels of immigration in terms of the burden it is placing on our small island, its services and infrastructure. I don’t hold with the idea that we need to keep bringing more and more people here, simply to generate more money, as I don’t think that is necessarily the outcome, there is such a thing as quality of life, and making better use of the resources we already have.\n\nWe must overhaul our education system and strive for technical excellence in our manufacturing industries.\n\nI am not Potteries born, but I have very strong links to the city of Stoke. I was born and bred in Whitchurch. My parents used to come to the Potteries through the lanes that passed through Audlem, Woore and Madeley. They would buy crockery for our furniture store and traded in second hand furniture mostly. It was a great day out for us kids, and sometimes we would be allowed to smash the seconds against the wall, which we greatly enjoyed.\n\nI joined the Royal Air Force in 1979 and left in 1987. I have very fond memories of that time. On leaving the RAF, I settled in Stafford and later in Fenton, and once worked for a refrigeration company in Hanley, also an Air Handling Unit manufacturer, based on Shelton Old Hall Road, Stoke before becoming self employed. I have worked for myself in and around the north and centre of the county for the past 35 odd years. I had a shop in City Road and have played football and squash in order to keep fit. My main hobby is Microlight flying, and I have an Instructor and Ground Examiner rating.\n\nI no longer live in the city, sadly I was driven out by crime. My business premise and vehicle were being regularly broken into, and a business simply cannot survive under those conditions. So I looked to rent a property in a countryside setting, just outside Eccleshall. Regardless, Stoke is still my city, and I am an adopted son. I have a strong desire to be of service to the people of South Stoke, if elected I would immediately focus on reducing the drug problems in the city.\n\nI am standing for Parliament because I want my grandchildren to enjoy and feel the same freedom that I felt growing up as a child, benefitting from living in a society that is basically decent, honest, and caring and in which you feel safe, be it on the streets, or in your bed.\n\nI want a smaller government and less interference in our daily lives, I want the war on motorists and indoctrination of our kids in the education system to end.\n\nI find the concept of a global government concerning. I want the “fear bulletins” that are regularly released from Downing Street, and various organisations and institutions, to stop. I want the people of this nation to be happy again.\n\nThere is no need to scare people constantly. We should be treated as grownups, able to think for ourselves and to be allowed to be happy on a daily basis. We should be led by people who want the best for us, and don’t believe the best way to rule us, is through division and fear.\n\nAbove all I want leaders who are patriotic, and not simply self serving, until these are in place, I fear for the future of western civilization.",

With Brexit still not secured by the current Government I have joined Reform Party UK to keep fighting for those British values we need to protect.\n\nI believe funding for local areas should be given to local councils as they know best where to spend their money, not from Westminster down.  The current Government have no idea what it is like to survive financially in the current climate or high taxes, low incomes and rising costs of living.  Local councils need to step up to what is really needed and they too need a shake up to bring politics into the modern world for the people who live in their local areas.\n\nThe crumbling NHS has been and still is mismanaged.  People are dying in corridors as there are not enough employees available to work.  We heralded the Doctors and Nurses in the Covid era yet we have done nothing to show how much we value them.\n\nOur local schools are run in buildings that should have been knocked down years ago, there is again no money available for renovating or rebuilding.  Teachers once revered as a superior vocation is also struggling to employ staff as the pay is outdated and their powers to run their schools has been given over to bureaucrats in parliamentary offices, who have no idea of the struggles.  The rising needs of specialist educators grows as our children’s needs change. \n\nWorking in secondary state education it is my passion to ensure education is the best it should be and any other local issue that needs fighting for I am prepared to act.

Meanwhile Mr Mitchell has been “earning” £182,000 a year, for working just 34.5 days as a consultant to a number of businesses, this in addition to his MP salary of around £82,000 (figures reported in 2021, see Reference 1 below).\n\nSo much for his political career being in tatters over “Plebgate” in 2014 (see Reference 2)\n\nWhen not working extra jobs to benefit his own pocket, in his role of International Development Minster, he has been very involved with, and very enthusiastic about, giving away our money to try to reduce poverty across Africa, rising poverty levels in Sutton Coldfield appear to concern him somewhat less (see Reference 3).\n\nLabour-controlled Birmingham City Council and has always under invested in Sutton Coldfield, and has recently effectively declared itself bankrupt, by issuing a section 114 notice.\n\nCrime in our town is at epidemic levels, with shoplifting in particular going “through the roof”.\n\nAt the time of writing, I am the only declared Prospective Parliamentary Candidate who actually lives permanently in Sutton Coldfield. If elected, I would devote 100% of my time rebuilding Sutton, there will be none spent on “second jobs”, no matter how much I could earn, in how short a space of time.\n\nReform UK’s plans to cut business taxes would massively help local businesses thrive again, putting some much needed investment into all of our shopping areas and increasing visitor numbers. As your MP I would relentlessly strive to get more police officers onto our streets; Reform UK has committed to hiring 40,000 extra police nationally, over a five year period.\n\nOur commitment to raising the personal tax threshold to £20,000 would greatly benefit the less well off, and put more money in their pockets to spend locally.\n\nI believe only a truly local person will have the passion and commitment to ensure that our town undergoes the regeneration it deserves.\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/heres-how-much-birmingham-solihull-22099743\n\n2. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/pleb-andrew-mitchell-loses-libel-case\n\n3. https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/minister-andrew-mitchell-speech-on-the-future-of-international-development",

It's about demanding transparency and accountability in how our public services are managed, ensuring every penny of taxpayer money is spent wisely. And it's about addressing immigration with a balanced approach that respects genuine asylum while safeguarding our borders.\n\nBut to bring about this change, I need more than just my voice; I need yours. This campaign is a collective effort, a shared journey towards creating a Vale of Glamorgan that reflects our values, meets our needs, and fulfils our aspirations.

His commitment to his work is matched only by his love for his family, which includes four children and a cherished grandchild.\n\nWhen Steve isn't navigating the railways, he enjoys indulging in craft ales, adding to his collection of tattoos, and immersing himself in the rich sounds of jazz, funk, and soul music.

The incompetence and chaos that have marked the administrations of both the Conservative and Labour parties over the past few years have left him disillusioned and frustrated.\n\nDriven by a sense of duty and a desire for meaningful change, Steve has decided to step into the political arena, a significant departure from his previous stance of political non-involvement. He believes that the time has come to reform the way the country is organised and run, and he sees the Reform UK party as the vehicle for this change.

For example, all the main parties currently support energy policies that will inevitably lead to great impoverishment of UK citizens – all to no purpose.  The Liberal Democrats’ Nick Clegg vetoed clean & green nuclear power in 2010 because it would “only come on stream in 2021 or 2022”: just think how different things would be now if that infrastructure spend (at historically low interest rates) had gone ahead. \n\nI would encourage everyone to read Reform UK’s Contract, which outlines how we will make the UK a better, safer and fairer place for all.

Born into a family with a proud history of service and hard work, she is the daughter of a dedicated Serviceman and the granddaughter of a miner.\n\nHer journey in Bridgend has been marked by a diverse career, including teaching in local schools, contributing to Local Government, and managing her own department in Bridgend's privately run prison. Transitioning to entrepreneurship, Caroline owned three small businesses in Bridgend and Porthcawl, fostering local employment and economic growth.\n\nCaroline's dedication to public service reached new heights from 2016 to 2021 when she was elected as a Member of the Welsh Parliament, representing the people of Bridgend. During her term, she actively participated in the legislative process, attending 331 parliamentary sessions, delivering 344 speeches, and posing 450 questions, showcasing her commitment to effective governance.\n\nBeyond politics, Caroline is deeply engaged in her community, demonstrating a heartfelt connection to causes close to her. As a Buddy for breast cancer patients, she met with 18 individuals in 2023, embodying her commitment to supporting those facing adversity. Serving as the Chairman of a local veteran's hub, she pays tribute to the armed forces, emphasizing the importance of gratitude for the safety they secure for the nation.\n\nCaroline's passion for her community is evident in her advocacy for residents' concerns. She addresses the challenges faced by Wales, expressing concern about the feeling of desperation in many areas, the plight of the homeless, and the neglect of veterans.\n\nShe critiques the state of public services, citing the imbalance in the NHS and the challenges faced by farmers and students. Her vision for Reform UK/Cymru resonates with a call for lower taxes, energy cost reduction, public sector reform, border control, and economic stimulus. The party's commitment to abolishing VAT on domestic fuel, eliminating business rates for small and medium firms, and investing in military support underscores Caroline's drive for positive change.\n\nCaroline urges voters to be bold, emphasizing that Reform offers a distinct alternative to traditional party politics. With an eye on leaving a legacy for future generations, she envisions a Wales and a UK that are not broken but thriving through effective leadership, informed decision-making, and a reduction in wasteful practices.",

The two-party system gives us the illusion of democracy, but whomever you vote for - Labour or Conservatives - you will get more of the same. If you want to see things really change you need to change who you vote for. If you want Reform you need to vote REFORM.\n\nIt seems the current establishment is working against the people not for us. I want to see the people of the United Kingdom put first for a change, I want to see life made easier for people in their everyday lives not harder. That means to start with, raising the tax threshold so that we have enough money to live on before we are taxed, we need to stop them using the British people as cash cows.\n\nHello. My name is Francoise Thompson, I’m a creative with a vision of how life could & should be if we had a government that worked with our interests at heart and actually carried through on their promises. My background is in Media & Design, I’m also interested in psychology so am keenly aware of human behaviour, and passionate about natural health and wellbeing.\n\nI am passionate about this country and our communities, and in returning this great country back to the amazing place we know it is. I like most am experiencing the difficulties the recent governments have brought to our country and our everyday lives. The overbearing taxes, rules, red tape, constant threat of fines, long wating lists, open borders and their cowardice to tackle problems head on.\n\nGrowing up in Hillingdon I have witnessed the changes over the years and can see that Hayes & Harlington in particular needs change having the highest crime rate in the whole borough. Parts of Hayes & Harlington have been allowed to become run down and overcrowded, a concrete high-rise jungle rife with crime, where you wouldn’t go out at night. This needs to change. We need a police presence back on the streets and we need most importantly to re weave the fabric of community cohesion and accountability that brings stability and safety.\n\nOn a local level I’d like to see more green spaces preserved and created, trees planted in our high streets to promote a pleasing environment in which to live, bringing good mental health and well being.\n\nI want to see our children go into training programmes and internships not university debt, our food grown locally and organically without toxic chemicals, good food and healthy lifestyle and gardening taught in schools, this in turn will put less burden on our NHS.\n\nReform has the common sense approach to tackling all the issues we are facing, so I hope you will join us.\n\nMy best wishes\n\nFrancoise Thompson",

        "statement_to_voters": "Another Brick in the Wall!\n\nI am not a career politician. I am a registered mental health nurse working for the NHS and you may have heard this before, but… I have a dream. I dream of a world where individuals feel empowered to succeed and where that hard work pays off. Where we have freedom of speech without offense or persecution. Now I believe that dream is achievable, but this is where I need your help.\n\nMany of you may; or may not be familiar with me as a town councillor in Hetton Town Council. Where I help to support the local community in dealing with the issues raised. Or as my role earlier as a nurse within the NHS. However, I am also your candidate in the upcoming general election with Reform UK.\n\nMy journey did not start there. I ran for youth parliament at an early age and sat on many youth committees as I grew up in the small village within the town of Houghton-le-Spring. I was raised with values and under the dogma of Labour policies in which I felt was the backbone of the community; or as I soon came to realise was the cancer.\n\nAs my career began to develop, I became a manager of a community interest company that supported families and individuals of all ages with difficulties around neurodiversity. Particularly autism, as I have a strong connection, having been diagnosed with the condition myself.\n\nI reached out to city councillors in various areas where I received some support from certain Labour Councillors, until it became apparent how my strong, hard efforts were benefiting them. After seeing these councillors use my voluntary work to apply for their own funding and meet with me to tell me how to cheat the system, I walked away from what I can only describe as corruption.\n\nKeeping my morals and my dignity, I joined Reform UK. With Reform, I have found my home. I have joined a community in which I feel supported. I share my story so that you may find your home too. It may not be with Reform, but there will always be support here for you too.\n\nPink Floyd released the album “The Wall” in 1982 about being tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers. The wall to me, is a depiction of the Labour “Red Wall” and as with all political walls, needs to fall. We need to celebrate diversity in choice, not only in the protected characteristics but within the belief of politics. I am not another brick in the wall, and neither are you.\n\nMy hope is to remind the world that justice, fairness, and freedom are more than just words—they are perspectives. These words that can offer the means to meaning and for those that will listen, the enunciation of truth. Bring back democracy; I do this for my family, I do this for my friends.\n\nBritain NEEDS Reform!",

They don’t support or fulfill the very policies and promises they are elected on. In direct contrast to those promised policies, they consistently adopt unanimous policies that are either deceptive or can only be described as anti-democratic.\n\nYear after year, over my lifetime, it has steadily worsened, accompanied by the immensely aggressive nature of our government's obsession with interfering in both our lives and freedoms. I felt that to remain on the sidelines and not stand for my own beliefs would be nothing less than a Faustian Bargain.\n\nBritain has been greatly injured over the last 50 years—in education, health, security, economy, diplomacy, and in direction. I pose a simple question: What is our goal as Britain? No goal equals no direction. No direction equals no mobility, and no mobility equals no action taken. If, like me, you can discern the symmetry between the parties that were in power and the injured sectors of our country, then you are not alone and are most welcome.\n\nReformUK, on the other hand, has not only supported my views but has also inspired them. The party aligns closely with my perspective regarding the direction our country has taken and where it could lead with leaders and supporters who genuinely care about the future of Britain.\n\nIts alignment with my perspective on the trajectory of our country and the potential under compassionate leadership offers a refreshing contrast to the status quo. ReformUK embodies the promise of a better future for Britain, where genuine concern for the nation's well-being takes precedence.\n\nMy name is Jamie-Lee McMillan, I’m the PPC for Lincoln, I was raised in Sleaford and now live a stone throw away from RAF Waddington.\n\nI look forward to hearing from and standing for you all.",

My grandfather before him was a miner in the Rising Sun Pit for 48 years, so I come from a family that has been part of this area's shipyard and mining communities, and I'm sorry to say they were Labour voters.\n\nAs a child, Wallsend and Byker were so exciting, it was thriving with different kinds of businesses, there were fresh fish shops, Tom Owens fruit and veg in Wallsend, also a bike repair shop in Byker, we even had big department stores like Parishes in Byker and the co-op in Wallsend. Over the past few years, I've watched Wallsend High Street and Shields Road deteriorate and now we have barber shops, charity shops, vape shops, nail bars and more takeaways than I can mention, gone are the fresh fish shops and fruit and vegetable shops.

Our city deserves better, and it’s time for a change.\n\nFor too long, our political landscape has been dominated by the same two parties, like a never-ending episode of “EastEnders.” The Conservative Party and Labour have been playing ping-pong with our future, and we’re all feeling the whiplash. They’ve had more chances than a contestant on “The X Factor,” and yet here we are, still waiting for someone to hit the right note.\n\nThe Conservative Party likes to brag about their economic prowess, but let’s be honest – their idea of economic competence is a bit like putting a plaster on a broken leg and calling it a day. We’ve had years of austerity, cuts to essential services, and infrastructure that looks like it was built by a kid with a Lego set. And don’t even get me started on the housing crisis – I’ve seen better planning in a student flat-share.\n\nThen there’s Labour. They promise us the moon and the stars, but end up delivering… well, moonshine. They’re so busy fighting among themselves that they’ve forgotten who they’re supposed to be fighting for.\n\nAgain, It’s like watching a soap opera, except nobody’s getting married, and we’re all just waiting for the next dramatic exit.\n\nLeeds Central and Headingley deserves better, you, as British people, deserve better! You deserve a representative who doesn’t just talk the talk but walks the walk – and preferably without tripping over their own feet. That’s why I’m here, standing as your Reform UK candidate. We believe in practical, common-sense policies that actually make a difference. Imagine that!\n\nWe need better structure for our NHS, because nobody should have to wait so long for a doctor’s appointment that they’ve memorized every magazine in the waiting room. We need an education system that prepares our kids for the future, whether they’re aspiring to be astronauts or the next big YouTube star.We need an educational system where we don’t have them sit in silence and listen to Baga Chipz from ru Paul’s drag race read them ‘100 reasons why palastine should be free’ telling them this is how you should live your life, and this is what you should believe. We need affordable housing so young people can stop living with their parents and start living their lives – I mean, how many of you are tired of your mum asking why you’re home so late?\n\nUnlike the Conservatives, we won’t leave our social services looking like they’ve been through a shredder. Unlike Labour, we won’t make promises that sound great until you realize they were written on the back of a napkin. We’re committed to real, sensible reforms that work for everyone, not just a chosen few or the loudest voices.\n\nIt’s time for a new voice in Leeds Central and Headingley. A voice that speaks for the people, not for party politics. A voice that knows how to get things done without turning it into a reality TV show. Together, we can break the cycle of disappointment and build a future we can all be proud of.\n\nThank you for your support. Let’s make this the start of real change. Let’s choose Reform UK.",

The great country described in the pages of history books and remembered fondly by elderly family members seems to exist only in another reality, in contrast to the defeated and demoralised nation we find ourselves in today.\n\nTeesside has been in many ways the perfect example of this decline. All my life I have heard the non-stop, desolate droning of Labour politicians complaining endlessly about the neglect and mistreatment of our area, and how everything is the fault of someone else – whether it be the spectre of the Tories in Westminster, or anyone who dares to challenge their grip on power. While there may be a kernel of truth to the idea that the majority of Westminster politicians couldn’t care less about the fate of the former industrial heartlands, far more damaging has been the outrageous incompetence and corruption of the Labour administrations that have run our town into the ground, and who seem to actively oppose any attempts to truly transform it for fear of losing their ‘grim up North’ sacred cow.\n\nIt does not have to be this way. I have lived in a number of places around the country, and have seen what success and regeneration look like. There is no reason why Middlesbrough could not have its own Regent Street, Grey Street, or King’s Parade. As the children of Ironopolis, the descendants of those whose toil helped build some of the finest structures in the world, there is no reason why we can’t rebuild the Infant Hercules once again, and have a town (or even dare to hope for a city) that we can showcase to the world with pride. This is exactly what I thought I was voting for when I reluctantly cast my ballot for a Tory party promising the world in 2019 – only to be cruelly reminded of the treachery of that malicious organisation after as little as 12 months.\n\nThat is why I am running for parliament. The people ripping this country apart will not be around for long enough to see the consequences of their malice – but this is my home, and I don’t have that luxury. As Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East, I hope to use my varied career experience in education, engineering, and business management, as well as my academic experience at both Durham and Cambridge Universities, to lift up the people of both Middlesbrough and Britain as a whole, and to help build a hometown and country that we can look on with genuine pride.",

I therefore voted to leave. Having done so, when the results were announced, I was happy that the UK had signalled its intention to leave the European Union. \n\nTo let you into a secret, at that time I would have accepted the result even if we had lost. \n\nHowever, we won. \n\nI then watched 3 years of lies and deception as politicians and civil servants went out of their way to stall the process. I could see what was happening and felt powerless and increasingly annoyed. Then came Boris with his oven ready Brexit deal which again was a farce but got him into power. Again, I thought, well that’s the best we are going to get. Then came Covid. As a plumber, I worked all the way through and took only the first tranche of the relief payments.\n\nThe government asked whether my business had been adversely affected; as it was not, I pursued no further payments. I then watched the government give millions away to con men and Conservative Party members and then make up lies to keep us controlled. All this time I WAS getting increasingly frustrated with the self-serving political class. \n\nMeanwhile general elections came and went, local elections came and went. There was never an option to vote for Reform UK. I thought, that if I didn’t feel I could ever vote Conservative or Labour and there wasn’t a candidate for Reform UK there must many more people that felt the same as me. I therefore put myself forward as a Reform Party candidate, not for myself but to give all those unhappy with the two major parties someone, and indeed something, to vote for. \n\nThroughout this period there have been immigrants arriving every day and again the government has shown no political will to do anything about them. \n\nI have never done anything like this before. I am looking for people who can help me in every way from advice to helping with leaflet drops and walkabouts. I believe if we can get the word out, send a message to the people, we stand a good chance of getting a result. I find from talking to people that some don’t even know about Reform UK, so leaflets and walkabouts initially will be most successful. \n\nThanks again for your interest and I look forward to your replies and comments",

        "statement_to_voters": "Brought up in North Lanarkshire, Sandra left school with no qualifications.  Before moving to the Highlands in 1989, she attended Glasgow University as a mature student, graduating with a BEng Engineering, before completing a Masters in Construction Law at Strathclyde University in 2003 while at home with her young children.\n\nA lengthy career in the Offshore Fabrication Industry, both UK and overseas, she successfully executed a variety of roles within this challenging industry before transitioning to renewables – all providing invaluable professional, personal and cultural experiences.\n\nSince returning home, Sandra has been an active community volunteer. Participated in various community groups, she also supported local salmon fishermen following the Scottish Government’s ban on the centuries-old tradition of coastal salmon-netting and more recently local opposition to the construction of an industrial scale anaerobic digester plant within her local community.\n\nThrough her career in the heavy fabrication industry, it frustrated her seeing politicians across all parties preside over Scotland’s industrial demise. Her passion to reverse this, motivated her to stand in the 2015 and 2019 General Elections; 2017 Council Election; 2021 Scottish Election and the current 2024 General Election. It was also a driving force behind her decision to campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nBoth our UK and SG have long championed renewables, indeed our former FM Alex Salmond once claimed Scotland had the potential to be the “Saudi Arabia of renewables” and back in 2010 the deputy First Minister Mr Swinney promised a renewable ‘jobs bonanza’ of 28,000 Scottish jobs, yet a decade later in Feb 2020, it was reported only 6% of these jobs had been delivered, the vast majority having gone overseas!\n\nWhether Renewable Development; Decommissioning Scotland’s Oil & Gas Platforms or other major developments, the political enthusiasm to ensure a level of ‘in-country’ procurement / ‘local’ skilled jobs to deliver that ‘Second Industrial Revolution’ has not been evident. Sadly, the failure to utilise our freedom from EU State Aid and Procurement Regulations and deliver these much needed local jobs, has been a failure of politicians both north and south of the border, and across the political divide!\n\nThe economic, social and health consequences of cross-party supported extensive lockdowns, followed by a cost-of living crisis, we now see an increase in unemployment and those economically inactive, whist millions across the country experience a decline in living standards – another example of the colossal failure of the current Political Establishment!\n\nOur politicians and political parties have failed us, the time is right for much-needed change, new blood to drive innovative policies to deliver for the ordinary people living and working within our local communities.\n\nIf elected as Member of Parliament for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, Sandra promises to work tirelessly to deliver that change.",

        "statement_to_voters": "Over the past few years, I’ve become very aware of politics in our country and found that none of the choices presented to me reflect the views of most people I know.  The decision the politicians are making affect the future of this country and my children.  As a father, I could no longer sit back and leave the decision-making to others. The media seems to have some misconceptions about what a Reform Party candidate is, so let me introduce my background and beliefs.  I was born in Scotland, although have lived in England for 25 years.  I am the son of a teacher who had the hard job of being a single mum in the 80s.  I grew up with not very much, which is why I’ve worked hard over the years to be able to provide for my family.  We live in the beautiful, leafy town of Fleet where we are active in our community and our church.  I even play Father Christmas at my children’s school.  My wife is a naturalised immigrant to the UK.  I have spent many years working internationally, but I understand the decision to leave the European Union and I wish our elected officials had taken on board the will of the democratic vote and done something with the potential the vote carried.  I’ve lost faith in the major political parties in the UK.  They all appear to want more rules, more regulations and more taxes, while providing less to the citizens of the country.   I’ve watched local businesses suffer due to the excesses of government, and I feel it is my duty to attempt to remedy that.  My community is suffering under the weight of inflation, which was brought on by poor decision-making in government and the lack of any opposition to counter those choices.   This country and its people have many great qualities which our elected leaders have chosen to ignore and diminish. They have instead chosen to sow division within the communities they are supposed to support and represent.   I joined Reform and chose to stand for the party because the party is made up of people who are successful, have professional skills, capabilities and knowledge of the real world and the desire and ability to deliver for the country.  Not career politicians who have no real world experience or connection to their constituents. Since the last election, Reform has rallied 620 candidates across the country, which shows we can deliver.    Our fully funded “contract with you” offers common-sense solutions and a clear plan for our future.  https://www.reformparty.uk/our-contract-with-you",

After years of higher and higher taxes, ever-increasing government borrowing, out-of-control immigration, and crumbling infrastructure and services it is time for real change!\n\nThe Tories and Labour have become almost indistinguishable from each other, and a vote for either party will simply bring in more of the same disappointments we have become all too familiar with. I believe the people need a real alternative; Reform UK and myself as its PPC for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard represent that alternative. Only Reform can stop the boats and get a handle on this out-of-control immigration issue. Only Reform UK will get the economy working for the people and tackle the cost-of-living crisis and put money back in hard working people’s pockets.\n\nOnly Reform will stand up for British values and common-sense policies to save Britain.\n\nCost of living crisis:\n\nWe need to put money back into the pockets of the British people, we need to incentivise people to get back into work and earning a living by increasing the basic rate of income tax threshold from £12,571 to £20,000.\n\nGet immigration under control:\n\nCurrent legal and illegal immigration is at catastrophic levels! This is completely unstainable and is not only damaging for our economy, workforce, infrastructure but also our core values and culture as a nation.\n\nReform the NHS:\n\nIn Britian we love our NHS and for good reason. But simply throwing an ever-growing sum of money at the NHS is not a sustainable we to keep this vital service operational. We need a full review into the way this service is run and managed. In terms of spending the average price per person in the population is in alignment with other western countries the issues faced by the NHS are in waste, incompetent management, bureaucracy and poor procurement.\n\nRemember you wont get change until you vote for change!\n\nIf you want to get involved, join us, volunteer and help us campaign then please contact me.",

It's no wonder that our youth are disillusioned and leaving the country in droves.

The obvious definition of a victim is one who has been the subject of crime or some sort of accident.\n\nI look at this from a slightly broader viewpoint.  Victims are those who, thanks to the incompetence of governments over the decades, cannot now afford to pay the mortgage, the energy bill or cope with the rising cost of food.  Added to this is the inability to access services for which every one of us has paid, like a decent education and proper healthcare.\n\nGovernment spending, taxing and borrowing is now totally out of control and there are no signs of it coming under control. The civil service is out of control.  Taking legal action against government policy was unheard of until now.\n\nTaxes are now on a par with the immediate aftermath of WW2, a time when we still had an Empire to administer and run down as well as vast debts as a result of the most destructive war the world has ever seen.\n\nI was selected to stand in Fareham and Waterlooville for Reform UK.
